	<p>Evidence that Apple is working on a product for people with diabetes is mounting.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/18/apple-ceo-tim-cook-test-drove-glucose-monitor.html?__source=twitter\" target=\"_blank\">CNBC</a>&nbsp;on Thursday reported that Apple CEO Tim Cook was spotted at the company&#39;s campus wearing &quot;a prototype glucose tracker on the Apple Watch.&quot; The news outlet reckons the device --&nbsp;should it actually come to market --&nbsp;would be a &quot;&#39;must have&#39; for millions of people with diabetes.&quot;</p><div style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: none; width: auto; text-align: center; float: left; color: rgb(38, 38, 38); font-family: Roboto-300, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 18.72px;\">&nbsp;</div><p>The rumor comes after CNBC last month reported that Apple had hired a &quot;small team of biomedical engineers&quot; who are working out of an office in Palo Alto, Calif., to develop a &quot;<a href=\"http://www.pcmag.com/news/353051/apple-secretly-developing-sensors-to-monitor-diabetes\" target=\"_blank\">holy grail for treating diabetes</a>.&quot; The &quot;super secret initiative&quot; --&nbsp;planned by the company&#39;s late co-founder Steve Jobs --&nbsp;aims to &quot;develop sensors that can noninvasively and continuously monitor blood sugar levels to better treat diabetes,&quot; according to the report.</p><p>Though the Cupertino tech giant is generally ultra tight-lipped about new products in its pipeline, Cook may have hinted about a possible Apple diabetes product in February. Speaking with students at the University of Glasgow in Scotland, where he received an honorary degree, Cook said he&#39;d been wearing a glucose monitor for &quot;a few weeks.&quot; He didn&#39;t say whether it was an Apple prototype or a device from a different company, however.</p><p>&quot;It&#39;s mentally anguishing to stick yourself many times a day to check your blood sugar,&quot; he said, according to CNBC. &quot;There is lots of hope out there that if someone has constant knowledge of what they&#39;re eating, they can instantly know what causes the response... and that they can adjust well before they become diabetic.&quot;</p><p><em>PCMag</em>&#39;s Tim Bajarin, who has diabetes,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.pcmag.com/commentary/353187/apples-diabetes-monitor-needs-to-be-affordable-non-invasiv\" target=\"_blank\">argued in a recent column</a>&nbsp;that if&nbsp;Apple tackles this area, a real breakthrough would be an affordable, non-invasive&nbsp;and accurate solution. He uses&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dexcom.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Dexcom&#39;s Continuous Glucose Monitoring</a>&nbsp;(CGM) and says &quot;it has changed the management of my diabetes for the better.&quot; But it requires a sensor on his stomach and two small, hair-like wires that get blood sugar readings from an interstitial fluid just below the skin every five minutes.</p><p>Monitoring via&nbsp;light pulses or sensors on a wrist band or watch, like Apple Watch, would be less invasive, but accuracy is still an issue.</p>
