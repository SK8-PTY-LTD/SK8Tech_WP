This week, <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> is reporting that Xiaomi is planning to join Samsung, Apple and fellow Chinese manufacturer Huawei in the elite club of smartphone makers building their own processors.</p><p>According to the paper’s sources, the company is planning to release its Pinecone chip within a month (which could have been great timing for MWC, as it happens).

Though it could help distinguish the company from a seemingly ever-growing number of smartphone makers in its home country. It would also make Xiaomi less reliant on Qualcomm, which is currently under heat for patent issues in India, a major market for the smartphone maker, where it launched the Snapdragon-powered Redmi Note 4 earlier in the year.</p><div><div></div></div><p>Xiaomi is also aggressively pushing for growth in additional markets, including Indonesia, where the company opened up a new plant this week, with the goal of manufacturing up to one million phones a year for the local market.</p><p>We’ve reached out to the company for comment.</p>"
