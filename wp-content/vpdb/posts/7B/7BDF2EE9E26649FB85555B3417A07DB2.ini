According to the company, Kaspersky Lab “has no ties to any government, but the company is proud to collaborate with the authorities of many countries, as well as international <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/tag/law/\" title=\"Law\">Law</a> enforcement agencies in the fight against cybercrime.”</p><p>The documents were published today by the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, accompanied by a letter from ranking Democrat, Rep. Elijah E. Cummings.</p><p>“I cannot recall any time in our nation’s history when the President selected as his National Security Advisor someone who violated the Constitution by accepting tens of thousands of dollars from an agent of a global adversary that attacked our democracy,” he wrote.</p><p>As a result of his involvement with Russia, Flynn’s remarkably brief 24 days in Trump’s cabinet have already come to a close, but Flynn could still face consequences from rules designed to prevent retired officers from receiving payments from foreign governments.</p><small>Featured Image: frankieleon/Flickr UNDER A CC BY 2.0 LICENSE</small>"
