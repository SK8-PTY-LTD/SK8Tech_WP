That’s because, not only do consumers expect to be able to engage with brands on any channel they desire, when things do go wrong it’s often necessary to switch the conversation from one channel to another, such as going from social to private messaging.</p><p>“The future of all customer service is in messaging. By building a fully integrated digital customer engagement platform, we can provide a comprehensive solution with the best of social and messaging, enabling our clients to engage their customers wherever they are,” said Joshua March, CEO and founder of Conversocial, in a statement.</p><div><div></div></div><p>“We see this acquisition as a vital extension to our platform, ultimately capturing and engaging those customers who favor web-based chat and enabling our clients to provide a seamless customer experience across all digital channels, on a single platform”.</p><p>Conversocial claims many leading brands as customers, including Google, Hyatt, Sprint, Alaska Airlines, Audi, and Tesco. The platform supports multiple social and messaging channels, such as Facebook, Messenger, Twitter, Instagram, Google+, SMS, and more.</p>"
