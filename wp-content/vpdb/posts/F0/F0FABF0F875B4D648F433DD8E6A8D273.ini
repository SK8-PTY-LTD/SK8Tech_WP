Before Line, there was </span>app#/entity\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">WhatsApp</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">, which had just 55 employees in 2014 when it sold to Facebook for $19 billion. Twitter, not really a messaging tool but sharing many of the features, peaked a few years ago around a $40 billion valuation. Tencent-owned </span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">WeChat</span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">, China’s hottest messaging and productivity app, has an internal valuation some analysts have pegged around $80 billion.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Those are just a few examples and mostly excludes valuations of assets inside larger companies, like Microsoft-owned Skype. Altogether, apps for messaging, video-chatting, sending pictures, and others with some combination of the same features have a collective valuation that could reasonably be estimated in the hundreds of billions of dollars. That reflects the fact that people all over the world use the apps constantly. Whether messaging makes money now appears to be a secondary concern.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Given how much money investors can make from these apps, we might expect to see them lining up to fund them, secure in the presumption that, even though many will fail, those that succeed will do so massively. And we might expect to see those losing bets accumulate.</span></p><div><div></div></div><p><strong>What the data shows</strong></p><p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">But is that the case? Using Crunchbase data, we set out to track how much money has recently gone into companies developing messaging apps or related services based on the concept of making it easier to exchange text, picture and video with friends and followers. Initially, we limited the search to companies that raised $5 million or more and focus more on individuals than enterprise customers.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">As it turned out, VCs have invested hundreds of millions in messaging companies that either haven’t raised a round for the past couple years, have folded, or don’t show evidence of expanding much beyond a niche user base. It’s probably too soon to write off many as failed investments, as they may have developed technology of value to an acquirer or may orchestrate a successful pivot. But it is safe to say these are not companies generating a lot of buzz in startup circles.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">You can go </span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">app/lists/messaging-companies-not-recently-funded/2f3b5a69-c34f-4f74-8999-3009844f4af1/company?new=false\">here</a> </span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">for a fuller list of messaging companies that haven’t closed a round in at least a couple years. Below are a few examples of companies that once hoped to be the next Snap or WhatsApp, and where they are now:</span></p><ul> <li> <span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Tango</span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">: The mobile messaging app raised has $360 million to date, with most of that total from its last funding, a $280 million in Series D round backed by Alibaba in 2014. However, user growth has stalled. According to industry watcher AppAnnie, Tango went from being one of the top 20 most downloaded U.S. apps to now not even cracking the top 150. Performance in other countries has followed a similar pattern. The company hasn’t raised a new round in three years.</span> </li> <li> <span style=\"font-weight:400;\">YikYak</span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">: Back in 2014, Yik Yak seemed to have everything going its way: a $62 million funding round backed by prestigious VCs and one of the top-ranked apps around. The service, which let people chat anonymously with others in their local area,</span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> drew millions of users. But it also sparked controversy for sometimes serving as a conduit for hate speech and cyberbullying. </span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">In December, the Atlanta-based company reportedly laid off 60 percent of its workers as usage dropped.</span> </li> <li> <span style=\"font-weight:400;\">TextPlus</span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">: Founded in 2007, Los Angeles-based TextPlus predates its Venice Beach-area neighbor, Snap, by a few years. But although it got started when Snap CEO Evan Spegiel was still in high school, TextPlus’s early start didn’t give it the edge. The company raised over $50 million in venture funding for its service providing free texting and calls for members. Its last round was two years ago. At its peak a few years ago, TextPlus was a top-100 U.S. app for downloads. Now it doesn’t even crack the top 400.</span> </li> <li> <span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Yub</span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">l: In a sector filled with speedy failures, Yubl (rhymes with bubble) still stands out. The UK-based messaging platform, backed with about $20 million in venture funding, launched and shut down all in about a year’s time. Yubl targeted younger users and offered settings for private and public conversations, as well as an explore</span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> mode. </span> </li> </ul><p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">That’s just a taste. But if for every Facebook there’s a dozen failures that wanted to stake out similar ground, we shouldn’t be surprised to see Snap break out from a host of similar firms. </span></p><small>Featured Image: J.
