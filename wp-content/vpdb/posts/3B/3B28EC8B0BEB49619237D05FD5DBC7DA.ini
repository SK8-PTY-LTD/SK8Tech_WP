Cellphones were just getting started,\" Mr DeToffol told the BBC.</p><p>\"Now, as our world becomes more electrified... people are getting sicker.\" </p><p>While he does not suffer himself, Mr DeToffol said he had heard from customers around the world, complaining of a variety of symptoms ranging from headaches and irritability to tinnitus and cardiac issues.</p><p>He did concede that radiation might not always be the cause.</p><p>\"At this point it is not the majority of the population, but it is a certain percentage that's made quite ill by this,\" he said.</p><p>The company's best-sellers were its baseball cap and balaclava, followed by \"hoodie\" tops that covered both head and torso, added Mr DeToffol.</p><p>\"The issue comes down to what part of the body does the person need to shield?\" he said.</p><p>\"Most popular tends to be shielding for the head - particularly for when people are sleeping.\"</p><h2>DIY FARADAY CAGES</h2><figure>
