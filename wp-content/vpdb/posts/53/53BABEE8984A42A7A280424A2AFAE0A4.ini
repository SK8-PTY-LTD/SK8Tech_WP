A crowdfunding campaign on Wikitribune's page Monday said enough money has already been raised to hire at least five journalists. </p><p>Wales has previously preached about more transparency in journalism. Wikitribune, independent from Wikipedia and the aforementioned foundation, aims to have content featuring full transcripts, video and audio. No word on when the first issue, which will be free and in English, will appear. </p><p>This effort comes as fake news has become a trending topic online, especially during last year's contentious US presidential race. Most notably, Facebook received widespread criticism for apparently letting members spread false news stories across the world's most popular social network. In response, the company launched several projects, including the News Integrity Initiative, a consortium with other tech companies, academics and nonprofits.  </p>
