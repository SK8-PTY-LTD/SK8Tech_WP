Now, almost 100 years later, we tend to sit. However, some people still stand. For those people there is the TerraMat.</p><p>The TerraMat is like a cat toy for you feet. It features a number of little bumps and ridges designed to let you stretch, exercise and massage your feet while you’re standing. It was created by two husband-and-wife teams, including an interior office designer, personal trainer and two engineers.</p><p>One of the inventors, Gerald Zingraf, suffered “a burst leg vein and failed valves that were caused from him standing still on a flat surface at his standing desk for 7+ hours a day.”</p><p>“That incident inspired the TerraMat to help keep people moving while they stand to avoid spinal compression, muscle fatigue and other standing-related issues,” he said. “With my mechanical engineering background and our co-founder’s knowledge of muscle imbalances and postural dysfunctions as a personal trainer, we put our heads together and after dozens of hours of design and testing we came up with the TerraMat.”</p><div><div></div></div><p>The team raised $105,000 and did a $108,000 Kickstarter. They also make a simple standing desk.</p><p>“We aren’t a ‘one-trick-pony’ desk company, but focus on all aspects of what’s required to stay healthy at your 9-5 which influences how we approach creating and launching new products,” said co-founder Camille Arneberg. The mat features 10 “power poses” that let you stretch, massage and feel better while standing.</p><p>So if you’ve been sitting for a long time and feel like standing, the TerraMat may just be the trick. If only our ancestors in the early 1900s — just before the invention of the first chair — had had such a wonderful thing.</p>"
