  <p>A group of 58 companies, including Lyft, Airbnb, and Dropbox, are protesting the revised travel ban on majority-Muslim countries that the Trump administration released earlier this month. The companies have submitted an amicus brief in support of a lawsuit filed by the state of Hawaii against President Trump. The group wants a temporary restraining order on the ban, saying that it “would inflict significant and irreparable harm on U.S. businesses and their employees” — echoing the complaint against Trump’s original attempt, which resulted in chaos at US borders.</p>
<p>Last month, 97 technology companies apple-google-facebook-opposition\">filed a similar amicus brief</a> in protest to Donald Trump’s original executive order on immigration. The new brief is somewhat lacking when it comes to some of tech’s bigger players like Apple, Google, Microsoft, Netflix, Spotify, and Uber — all of which signed onto the first amicus brief, but are all missing this time around. </p>
<p>The full amicus brief is embedded below:</p>      <div>
