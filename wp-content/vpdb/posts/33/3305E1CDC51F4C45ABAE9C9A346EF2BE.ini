Already, they have identified one very strong candidate, according to SpaceNews.</p><p>What makes a good landing spot for a Mars spacecraft? Proximity to ice near the surface of the planet is a big one, because that’s going to be &#x1f511; to any settlement’s ability to maintain itself during long spells without support from Earth-based shipments. Another important factor is low elevation and positioning near the equator for better sun exposure, for both power and thermal conditions. Those don’t normally co-exist with large quantities of ice not far from the surface, so that has helped narrow the potential touchdown points to just a handful.</p><div><div></div></div><p>These Mars landing points assume compatibility with SpaceX’s long-term goal of going to Mars and staying there, but the company could also land elsewhere on the planet to satisfy other needs, for scientific and commercial clients, for example.</p><p>Mars for SpaceX is still a relatively distant target – its planned first launch to the red planet was originally slated for 2018, but it’s now much more likely to occur in mid-2020 at the earliest, according to the company. At least it looks like that first mission will know exactly where it’s headed long in advance.</p><small>Featured Image: SpaceX</small>"
