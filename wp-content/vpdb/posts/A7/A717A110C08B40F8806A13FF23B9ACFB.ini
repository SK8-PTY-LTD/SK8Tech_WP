The in-store experience will be similar to the NYC location, with purchasing done via its Snapbot kiosks rather than human salespeople.</p><div style=\"width: 610px\"><img src=\"<<[site-url]>>/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Snap-opens-second-Spectacles-pop-up-shop-in-Venice-LA-1.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" srcset=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/img_4422.jpg 600w, https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/img_4422.jpg?w=150&amp;h=113 150w, https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/img_4422.jpg?w=300&amp;h=225 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" alt=\"Snap opens second Spectacles pop-up shop in Venice, LA\"><p>Snap’s Venice Spectacles shop will offer a similar Snapbot sales experience to the former NYC store</p></div><p>Snap’s IPO filing noted that it wasn’t earning meaningful revenue from hardware sales yet. But with Spectacles dropping the rarity thing and now being openly available to buy online, it could start generating some material income. As for what comes after Spectacles, our sources say Snap has investigated a drone and a 360 camera as potential products.</p>"
