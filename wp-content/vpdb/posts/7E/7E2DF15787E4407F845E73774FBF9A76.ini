<p>Chance’s admission is the first time we’ve gotten concrete numbers on the payments Apple gives to artists for exclusive content. Back in 2015 it was reported that apple-tidal\">Drake received $19 million</a> from Apple Music in his deal, which included a radio show on Beats 1 and becoming the de facto face of the streaming service.</p>

<p>As for the other players in the streaming world, Tidal gave each of its artist-owners a 3 percent stake to incentivize them to release exclusives on the service — and those stakes have become considerably more valuable now that Tidal is worth $600 million. Spotify doesn’t pay for exclusive content, and the terms of Amazon’s deal with Garth Brooks have not been disclosed. </p>
<p>We’ve reached out to Apple for comment. </p>      <div>
