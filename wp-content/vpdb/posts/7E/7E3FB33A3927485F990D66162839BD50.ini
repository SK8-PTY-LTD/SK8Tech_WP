This gives the company a total valuation of around $2.14B, which is well above the valuation of $1.5B it last raised at privately.</p><p>If the last few weeks are any indicator of recent IPO success, MuleSoft should do pretty well tomorrow.</p><div><div></div></div><p>Snapchat parent company Snap Inc. went public last week in a large $3.9B offering and also priced at $17, above its expected range. SNAP shot up 44% in its first day of trading, and while the share price has traded lower in recent days, it’s still trading above its IPO price. And earlier today luxury goods maker Canada Goose went public with a $225M raise, and ended the day up ~25% from its IPO price of $12 per share (which was also above the expected range).</p><p>MuleSoft’s IPO is the first public offering by a major enterprise software company this year, and if it goes well should signal more enterprise software companies going public soon – especially after the relative success of consumer technology company Snap Inc. last week.</p><small>Featured Image: © Philippe LEJEANVRE/Getty Images</small>"
