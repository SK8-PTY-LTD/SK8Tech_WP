  <p>Today, researchers at Check Point Security app-telegram/\">announced a new attack</a> against WhatsApp and Telegram, targeting the way both chat <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/tag/services/\" title=\"Services\">Services</a> process images and multimedia files. Check Point was able to craft a malicious image that would appear normal in preview, but direct users to a malware-laden HTML page. Once loaded, the page will retrieve all locally stored data, enabling attackers to effectively hijack the user’s  account.</p>
<p>“By simply sending an innocent-looking photo, an attacker could gain control over the account, access message history, all photos that were ever shared, and send messages on behalf of the user,” said Oded Vanunu, head of product vulnerability research at Check Point.</p>
<p>For WhatsApp, a user had to purposefully open the sent image, making the exploit impractical for botnets or mass surveillance. The vulnerability was more difficult to exploit on Telegram, requiring a user to open a video in a separate Chrome tab — something one Telegram representative described as “a <em>very</em> unusual user interaction.”</p>
<p>The vulnerability was reported to both <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/tag/services/\" title=\"Services\">Services</a> on March 8th, and both have since changed their systems to protect against similar attacks. WhatsApp did not respond to a request for comment.</p>      <div>

<p>Unlike conventional email or chat <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/tag/services/\" title=\"Services\">Services</a>, WhatsApp and Telegram have no way of reading messages sent between users, a crucial part of the promise of end-to-end encryption. In this case, that promise may have made it easier for the malicious image to slip through. With no mechanism for intercepting messages in transit, it is far more difficult to scan for viruses or other malicious attacks sent using the service.</p>
<p>In November, Check Point uncovered app-security\">a malware campaign</a> that infected over 1 million Android phones to up-vote products in the Google <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/services/aso/\" title=\"Play Store\" target=\"_blank\">Play Store</a>.</p>
