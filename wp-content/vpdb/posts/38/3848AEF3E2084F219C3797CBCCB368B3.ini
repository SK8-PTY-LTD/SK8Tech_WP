They included:</p><ul>
<li>pages explicitly for men with a sexual interest in children</li>
<li>images of under-16s in highly sexualised poses, with obscene comments posted beside them</li>
<li>groups with names such as \"hot xxxx schoolgirls\" containing stolen images of real children</li>
<li>an image that appeared to be a still from a video of child abuse, with a request below it to share \"child pornography\"</li>
</ul><p>Of the 100 images only 18 were removed.</p><p>According to Facebook's automated replies, the other 82 did not breach \"community standards\". They included the apparent freeze frame.</p><figure>
