Kuo previously stated that Apple will stick to the gentle 2.5D curve because a full-on curved display would be harder to make on a large scale and make the iPhone less drop-proof.</p><p>Apple is rumored to be loading the 10th anniversary iPhone with a ton of premium features like OLED screens, a high screen-to-body ratio, and AR capabilities. All these add-ons may result in an iPhone that costs well over $1,000. While OLED displays apples-10th-anniversary-iphone-will-likely-cost-more-than-1000\" target=\"_blank\" data-component=\"externalLink\">may be a driving force</a> in the price increase -- Apple apple-might-buy-million-curved-oled-screen-from-samsung-rumor/\">reportedly spent billions of dollars</a> securing them from Samsung -- other iPhone parts could keep the price high regardless if the iPhone's screens are curved or not.</p><p>For instance, making an OLED screen work with the iPhone's 3D touch pressure-sensitive technology could also hike up the price, Digitimes reports. While 3D touch sensors cost Apple $9 (about £7.40/AU$11.89) in current iPhones, the new OLED 3D touch sensors could cost $15 (about £12.33/AU$19.82) according to the report. While this may seem like a few bucks, it represents a 60 percent price increase for a single component.</p>
