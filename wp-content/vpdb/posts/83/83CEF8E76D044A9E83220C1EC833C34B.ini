        </div>                        <p>Just on Friday, Avast detected up to 52,000 attacks from the WanaCrypt0r 2.0 ransomware, also called the WannaCry ransomware. The majority of the new malware was targeting Russia, Ukraine and Taiwan, Avast Threat Lab team lead Jakub Kroustek said.</p><p>The malware has spread across 74 countries so far. On the Malware Tech blog's tracker, cybersecurity researchers showed that more than 70,000 computers have been affected by the ransomware.</p><p>The UK's National Cyber Security Centre, the Department of Health and NHS England are working to support hospitals that have been affected. IT systems have been shut down to prevent the virus from spreading further throughout the network. Hospitals are discouraging people from visiting unless they need emergency treatment.</p><p>Ransomware is malware that encrypts important files, essentially locking people out of their computers unless they pay up or have their entire system deleted. Attacks of this kind have spiked in the last year, jumping from 340,665 attacks in 2015 to 463,841 in 2016, according to Symantec. The health care industry has become a major target, with <span section=\"shortcodeLink\">ransomware making up more than 70 percent of malware attacks</span> against hospitals, pharmacies and insurance agencies.</p><p>The ransomware is holding each computer hostage for $300 in Bitcoin (roughly Â£230 or AU$400). The malware demands that hospitals pay by May 15, or all the encrypted files will be deleted by May 19, according to cybersecurity firm Foursys. The firm manages cybersecurity for 140 of the NHS's hospitals.</p><p>The NHS said no private patient data has been stolen. Andy Wool, Foursys's marketing director, said it wasn't a targeted attack on the NHS, but an exploit against their system's vulnerability. The same ransomware hit Telefonica in Spain.</p><p>\"Emergency operations may have been cancelled, and automated systems that help monitor in and outpatients could be affected as well,\" Wool said. \"It is all hands on deck to try and stop the spread.\" </p><p>The ransomware uses an vulnerability on Microsoft's older systems. The company patched the issue in March, but many of the NHS's computers are still running on Windows XP, Wool said. The exploit was first discovered by the National Security Agency, whose hacking tools were leaked by a group called the Shadow Brokers. </p><p>The NSA did not respond to requests for comment.</p><p>Multiple hospitals in the NHS Trust relayed the same message across <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/services/content-marketing/\" title=\"Social Media\" target=\"_blank\">Social Media</a>, advising people against heading to hacked facilities while they are suffering from IT problems.</p><div>
