</div><p>Mr Maas quoted research which suggested Twitter deletes only 1% of the hate speech it is told about by users, and Facebook, 39%.</p><p>\"This isn't sufficient yet,\" said Mr Maas.</p><p>Racism and hate speech are believed to have become more prevalent on German <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/services/content-marketing/\" title=\"Social Media\" target=\"_blank\">Social Media</a> following the arrival of large number of refugees in Germany. </p><p>Any content that was \"clearly criminal\" would have to be removed within 24 hours under conditions outlined in the draft <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/tag/law/\" title=\"Law\">Law</a>. If, after an investigation, content is found to be criminal then that must be removed in seven days. The people who posted the illegal content must also be told about its deletion. </p><p>The proposed <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/tag/law/\" title=\"Law\">Law</a> would require each network to run fully staffed, round-the-clock reporting systems and to name an individual responsible for handling complaints. That person could face an individually levied fine of five million euros if companies break laws governing what can be published.</p><p>Mr Maas said the <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/tag/law/\" title=\"Law\">Law</a> could apply to fake news articles if they proved to be slanderous, defamatory or libellous. </p><p>Facebook did not comment directly on the proposal but said tests it commissioned showed it removed a higher percentage of illegal content than Mr Maas claimed. The social network said it expected to have 700 people employed in Berlin by the end of 2017 overseeing its efforts to review flagged content.</p><p>German digital trade association Bitkom criticised the proposed <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/tag/law/\" title=\"Law\">Law</a>. It told the Financial Times that the requirement to remove material within 24 hours on sites that handle more than one billion posts per day was \"utterly impossible to implement in operational terms\".</p>
