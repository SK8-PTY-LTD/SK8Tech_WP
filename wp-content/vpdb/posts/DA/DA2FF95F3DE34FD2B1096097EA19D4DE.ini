<div data-ad=\"inpage-video-top\">
        </div>                        <p>So I went to Saturday's March for Science in San Francisco not so much to people-watch but to see if someone could come up with a pithy phrase that would truly send a message about science to everyone. </p><p>I stared at the hundreds of signs and put them up for peer review. Well, I did spend a few years in advertising. </p><p>A significant proportion of the signs were personally aimed at President Trump, which seems a touch narrow-minded and plays into his Twittering fingers. He isn't the first on his party's side to negate science.</p><p>So while many might have been amused at a sign that read \"Trump doesn't believe in climate change because he can't imagine anything hotter than his daughter,\" it's not quite the heart-winner that scientists need in order to make their case.</p><p>Some signs were rebuttals to presidential tweets. For example: \"I'm not getting paid for this. Trust me, I'm a postdoc\" is funny, for those who know how little postdoctoral fellows are paid and that Trump insinuated that anyone who marches against him is being paid. But to a broader audience? Not quite.</p><p>It seems clear that while the scientific marchers had put in a lot of effort, there were many in-jokes that wouldn't translate to the masses. </p><p>\"If you're not part of the solution, you're part of the precipitate,\" may be amusing, but again, only to scientific minds. </p><p>At a relatively sublime level, there were \"Copernicus died for your sins,\"  \"Science gives me a hadron\" and \"Girls just want to have funding.\" Still, though, I couldn't find anything that would make a Trump supporter -- or even a fence-sitter -- care. Too many signs, indeed, smacked of superiority.</p><p>Science is long-winded, complicated and intellectual. Human minds are, too often, visceral, prejudiced and ineffectual. </p><p>Many scientific marchers had plumped for rational messages. Those often these fail when it comes to persuasion. </p><div section=\"shortcodeRelatedLinks\">
