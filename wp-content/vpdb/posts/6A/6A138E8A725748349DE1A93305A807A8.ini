To do so, you upload a photo that serves as the foundation for a new style, thenyou  refine it by tweaking different “content weights” and “style weights.” TechCrunch’s Natasha Lomas found that it was a fairly drawn-out process due to uploading/processing/review times, though the company says that normally, it should take “an hour or so.”</p><p>You can see both new features in action in the video above.</p>"
