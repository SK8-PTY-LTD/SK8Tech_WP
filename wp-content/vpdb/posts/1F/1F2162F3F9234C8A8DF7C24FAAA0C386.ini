This year, for the first time, Xiaomi declined to provide annual sales figures, raising doubts about whether it can continue the impressive growth that gave it a $45 billion valuation two years ago.</p><p>Brazil-born Barra said in a Facebook post announcing his departure that his primary motivation is home sickness.</p><blockquote><p>What I’ve realized is that the last few years of living in such a singular environment have taken a huge toll on my life and started affecting my health. My friends, what I consider to be my home, and my life are back in Silicon Valley, which is also much closer to my family. Seeing how much I’ve left behind these past few years, it is clear to me that the time has come to return.</p></blockquote><p>He added that the company’s global footprint, which was his primary responsibility, is “in a very good place.”</p><div><div></div></div><p><em>More to follow</em></p>"
