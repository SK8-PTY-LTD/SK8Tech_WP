        <p data-dropcap=\"true\">It's hot and humid and I've been stuck in an almost non-moving car for about an hour as my taxi driver struggles to navigate the usual Jakarta traffic jam to my hotel from the airport. As I pondered the answer to the meaning of life, the universe and everything, motorbike drivers, unaffected by the congestion, whizz by my cab with nary a care.</p><p>About one hour and 40 minutes and 32 kilometers later, parched and in urgent need of a bathroom, I finally arrive at my central Jakarta hotel. It took about the same time to fly the 900 kilometers from Singapore to the Indonesian capital -- and that includes the immigration checks.</p><p>Jakarta ranks among the worst cities in the world when it comes to traffic congestion. If you thought LA was bad, it's nothing compared to places like Bangkok or Mexico City, and they're nothing compared to  Jakarta, according to a Castrol study.</p><p>The constant congestion has opened up new opportunities for the ride-sharing industry. Regional Uber-competitor Grab, for instance, is taking advantage of a local practice -- motorbike taxis, known as ojeks.</p><figure section=\"shortcodeImage\"><span><span itemprop=\"image\" itemscope itemtype=\"https://schema.org/ImageObject\"><img src=\"<<[site-url]>>/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/grabbike05.jpg\" height=\"0\" width=\"570\" alt=\"Ride sharing takes to two wheels in Southeast Asia        CNET's Aloysius Low takes a trip to Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia, to find out how Uber's competitors are innovating with different business models.\"><meta itemprop=\"url\" content=\"https://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/img/fcOxYN55R39oVCpDVhM8L0DHD_Q=/fit-in/570x0/2017/03/07/d60caac3-3084-4c69-848f-559519372dcc/grabbike05.jpg\"><meta itemprop=\"height\" content=\"0\"><meta itemprop=\"width\" content=\"570\"></span></span><figcaption><span><p>There are some shortcuts you can take on a bike.</p></span><span>

<div data-ad=\"inpage-video-top\">
        </div>                        <p>It's also cheap by western standards. An 8-kilometer ride costs just 12,000 Indonesian rupiah, a little less than a dollar. A hardworking driver can make about $525 (Â£495, AU$695) a month, which is twice the city's minimum wage.</p><p>Grab, which debuted its bike service in May 2015, isn't the only player in the market. It competes with hyperlocal <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/services/startup-consulting/\" title=\"StartUp\" target=\"_blank\">StartUp</a> Go-Jek, which began service in January 2015, and Uber, which launched UberMotor in Jakarta in April 2016. All three ride-sharing apps tap existing bike owners, which numbered around 77 million in 2012, to be drivers.</p><p>It's not clear which company is the biggest. Go-Jek says it has a combined 60 percent market share for the two-wheeler and car ride hailing business. (The ride-hailing business is a partnership with the country's largest taxi fleet, BlueBird.) Grab cites internal numbers that are similar, saying it has more than 50 percent of both the bike and car-hailing businesses. Uber declined to comment.</p><p>Both Go-Jek and Grab also use their bikers for courier <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/tag/services/\" title=\"Services\">Services</a>. Go-Jek also lets you request <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/tag/services/\" title=\"Services\">Services</a> such as having a make-up artist come over to give you a makeover.</p><p>GrabBike isn't limited to Jakarta, it's available in Bali and two  Vietnamese cities. It will be available soon in Bangkok. The Uber competitor has big plans for the region, one being to open two new R&amp;D facilities in  India and Vietnam. Meanwhile, Go-Jek doesn't have plans to launch outside of Indonesia and will focus on its home market, the largest in Southeast Asia.</p><h3>Danger, danger?</h3><p>It might be fast, but is it safe? Motorbikes are, after all, seen to be more dangerous than cars. A study last year of <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Motorcycle_Crash_Fact_Sheet.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" data-component=\"externalLink\">motorcycle accidents</a> in South Australia found 18 percent of the country's serious accidents in 2015 happened on bikes. One mistake from a careless car or truck driver can be fatal to a biker.</p><p>Jakarta is no safe haven for motorcycles. Road shoulders on expressways are often treated like an extra lane for impatient drivers. While accidents in the capital city have decreased, there were still about 7,400 traffic accidents that caused almost 700 fatalities in 2016, according to the Jakarta Traffic Police. </p><p>But if you're in town and need to get somewhere quickly, taking a bike is the quickest, cheapest and easiest solution to beating the jam. </p><p>So that's what I did.</p><div>
