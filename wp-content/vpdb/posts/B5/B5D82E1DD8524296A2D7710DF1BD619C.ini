  <p>Google Talk — affectionally known as “Gchat” — is finally getting replaced for good. Google actually released Hangouts back in 2013 as a more feature-filled chat service to take the place of Talk in the Gmail sidebar, but users have been able to stick with the older, more basic service if they chose. </p>
<p>That’s changing on June 26th, when anyone still using Gchat will be forcibly transitioned over to Hangouts. It’s not a major change for most — there will still be chat built into Gmail, contacts will transition over, and Google has been trying to get people to switch over to Hangouts for the last <em>four</em> years, so maybe it’s time for Talk to go. The Google Talk Android app will also stop functioning, as will any third-party apps designed for Talk. (Again, anything using Hangouts — which is essentially the same thing — will still be fine.) </p>
<p>Still, it’s sad to see the messaging service go, even if it’s mostly just in name — Gchat was a huge way of communicating on the internet back in in the early 2000s, and harkens back to a simpler time when AIM ruled supreme. Fortunately, Google has at least seven other messaging services that you can use, including Allo, Duo, Hangouts, Android Messages, Voice, and app-without-a-keyboard.html\">Supersonic Fun Voice Messenger</a>, so you’ve got plenty of other options to use going forward. (One could also wonder why Google is switching people over to Hangouts when Allo exists, but that’s a thought exercise left for another time.)</p>
<p>Google also confirmed that it will be removing SMS support from Hangouts (as previously rumored), and encouraging Android users to switch over to the newly renamed Android Messages app. It’s a move that speaks both to Google’s increasing push for RCS messaging, as well as the company’s ambitions to reposition Hangouts into a viable business messaging tool to take on competitors like Slack. </p>      <div>
