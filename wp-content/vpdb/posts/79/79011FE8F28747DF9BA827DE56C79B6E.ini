  <p>Sephora is joining multiple other companies in recognizing the importance AR is going to play in future beauty product shopping.</p>
<p>The makeup retailer introduced a “Sephora Virtual Artist” this week in an update to its apple.com/us/app/sephora-makeup-beauty-app-insider-tips-style/id393328150?mt=8\">iOS app</a>. The feature, which was developed in partnership with AR company ModiFace, scans your face, figures out where your lips and eyes are, and lets you try on different looks.</p>
<p>Right now, you can only play with lip colors, eyeshadows, and false lash styles. If you like the look, well, you can buy it. Convenient! The <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/tag/app/\" title=\"App\">App</a> also offers “virtual tutorials” that show you how to contour, apply highlighter, and create winged eyeliner. It overlays the tutorial on your face.</p>

<p>I played around with the <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/tag/app/\" title=\"App\">App</a> and found that it worked fine, but it didn’t do a great <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/tag/job/\" title=\"Job\">Job</a> overlaying the looks. The lipstick swatches, which I’d be most interested in, went on lightly. I didn’t get a good sense of the color, so I probably wouldn’t buy straight from the <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/tag/app/\" title=\"App\">App</a> — I’d still prefer to try products on in-person.</p>      <div>

</div>

      </div>

<p>The tutorials, however, are really cool. It’s infinitely preferable to see where to apply highlighter on your own face than to guess after watching a YouTube video. I might even use this at home when trying out a new look. </p>
<p>More generally, though, it’s obvious lots of companies see beauty as a lucrative area for tech developments. Physical devices, like the HiMirror Plus, scan users’ faces and recommend products and skin regimens. And other apps, like apple.com/us/app/makeupplus-natural-professional-makeup-looks/id973337925?mt=8\">Meitu’s MakeupPlus</a>, rely on a smartphone to overlay looks, getting at the same idea. It’s a smart move for Sephora to work on a proprietary product, although it’s late to the game and other apps are already doing a better <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/tag/job/\" title=\"Job\">Job</a>.</p>
