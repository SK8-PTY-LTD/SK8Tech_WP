  <p>Independent games have always been a crucial slice of the iOS app market. Now, Apple is adding a new section to the <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/services/aso/\" title=\"App Store\" target=\"_blank\">App Store</a> to better highlight these games from smaller studios, which can sometimes get lost in the shuffle of big-budget titles and free-to-play behemoths. </p>
<p>The new apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewMultiRoom?fcId=833686792&amp;ign-mscache=1&amp;ign-msr=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.digitaltrends.com%2Fgaming%2Fapp-store-indie-showcase%2F\">Indie Game Showcase</a> will feature new games and also highlight older titles, and will be curated by Apple’s editorial team in a manner similar to other featured apps on the store. In addition to the individual app showcase, Apple is also adding a permanent sub-section for indie titles to the <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/services/aso/\" title=\"App Store\" target=\"_blank\">App Store</a>. </p>
<p>It’s an important move on Apple’s part given today’s app economy, which is heavily tilted toward bigger developers who can afford the marketing budgets to promote their games in a way that smaller dev teams typically can’t match. Apple’s new indie section could help provide a more level playing field for new independent developers, similar to the early days of the <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/services/aso/\" title=\"App Store\" target=\"_blank\">App Store</a> when the market wasn’t so crowded.</p>      <div>
