Premature infants are particularly vulnerable to respiratory failure and other complications from underdeveloped lungs, and the lungs -- and brains -- of the lambs in the experiment looked to have developed normally. The oldest lamb raised in the Biobag is now over a year old and appears healthy.</p><p>Lambs aren't human infants, and the device still has a way to go before it could conceivably reach the market. But Flake and his team are optimistic that the system could be in clinical trials within three years.</p><p>The best treatment for premature births is to prevent them in the first place. But for the cases where that isn't possible, the Biobag just might be the breakthrough that the tiniest of preemies need.</p>
