He firstly managed to unlock it by pressing her thumb on the phone and then used the 'Siri' function to ask for help and it dialed 999 to put him through to emergency services,\" said the police. 999 is the UK's emergency number.</p><p> 	  The police released a recording of Roman's phone call with the emergency dispatcher. On it, he explained that his mom was \"dead.\"</p><p> 	  When the dispatcher asked what he meant, he replied: \"It means she's closing her eyes and she's not breathing.\"</p><p> 	  The dispatcher managed to get Roman to tell her his address. Police and  paramedics arrived at Roman's house 13 minutes later, broke in and began to administer first aid. His mother regained consciousness at home, the police said, before being taken to hospital.</p><div>
