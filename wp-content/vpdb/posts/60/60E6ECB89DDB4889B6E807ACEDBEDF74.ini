  <p>The Galaxy Tab S3, Samsung’s latest flagship Android tablet, will be available next week. Pre-orders start tomorrow at Best Buy, Amazon, and Samsung’s own site, and the device will be in stores on Friday, March 24th. As previously leaked through Best Buy, it’ll cost $599.99.</p>
<p>That might make the Tab S3 a tough sell next to the 9.7-inch iPad Pro, a device which offers the same screen size, resolution, storage, quad-speaker array, and accessory support with a dramatically wider selection of tablet-optimized apps for the same entry price. Samsung isn’t exactly going all-out with the specs, either, outfitting the Tab S3 with the same Snapdragon 820 processor found in the Galaxy S7.</p>

</aside><p>The Tab S3 does come with its S Pen stylus in the box, however, whereas the Apple Pencil is an optional $99.99 accessory for the iPad Pro. And while both companies charge extra for their keyboard covers, Samsung’s is $20 cheaper at $129.99. We’ll have a better idea of how the Tab S3 shapes up once we give it a full review, which shouldn’t be too far off.</p>      <div>
