                                                </span></figcaption></figure><p>It's been a long while since I shared a deal on a desktop. Why? Because I continue to feel like no one wants or buys them anymore. But then everyone's all, like, \"What? I totally want a desktop! Stop hating on desktops, desktop-hater.\"</p><p>I will say that if you're itching to buy an <span section=\"shortcodeLink\">HTC Vive</span> or <span section=\"shortcodeLink\">Oculus Rift</span> VR system, you're going to need a powerful machine. And as someone who occasionally dabbles in video editing, a fast processor and high-end video card are a must.</p><p>To that end: For a limited time, HP is offering the Pavilion 560-p015HVR desktop for $649.99 shipped when you apply promo code <strong>HVR200</strong> at checkout. Regular price: $799.99. Oh, and don't forget to investigate your cashback options. Ebates, for example, offers a 4-percent rebate on HP purchases. That would bring your effective total down to $623.99. </p><p>It's hard to tell from the photo, but the Pavilion stands just 14.3 inches tall and measures 6.5 inches across -- so it's extremely compact. Indeed, this tower is probably better suited to living on your desk than below it.</p>
                            
                
                                
                                            


<div data-ad=\"inpage-video-top\">
        </div>                        <p>Despite its size, the system packs some impressive hardware: a Core i5 processor, 8GB of RAM, a 128GB solid-state drive <em>and </em>a 1TB hard drive, and, of particular interest to the VR-minded, a Radeon RX480 video card. </p><p>Also included: 802.11-all-the-letters Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.2, oodles of USB ports (including one USB Type-C!), and even one of those DVD-burner things. Here's a full rundown of the specs.</p><p>HP bundles a <em>wired </em>mouse and keyboard (blech), but otherwise this strikes me as nicely equipped system for the price. Indeed, it's still pretty rare to find a VR-ready desktop for under $1,000.</p><p>Your thoughts? Are you still in the market for desktops like this one? If so... why?</p><figure section=\"shortcodeImage\"><span><span><img src=\"<<[site-url]>>/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/20170315_58c955b830eaa.jpg\" alt=\"Get a VR-ready HP Pavilion desktop for $649.99        Normally $800, this compact PC has ample horsepower for anything you might want to throw at it.
