  <p>A few weeks ago, WhatsApp replaced the ability for users to set a text-based in-app app-stories-status-tab-snapchat-clone\">status with a Snapchat Stories clone</a>.

<p>Like Instagram, Facebook Messenger, and Facebook’s regular <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/tag/app/\" title=\"App\">App</a>, the WhatsApp version of Snapchat stories allows users to post pictures and videos that disappear after 24 hours. WhatsApp hoped that the picture and video stories would serve a similar function as the text-based statuses, but apparently users felt differently. Per WhatsApp, new About Status “will appear next to profile names anytime you view contacts, such as when creating a new chat or looking at Group info.”</p>

<p>There’s probably a lesson here somewhere about sticking to the things that users like about your <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/tag/app/\" title=\"App\">App</a> and not just running after the current popular thing that you’re competitors are doing, but given the industry’s pace of copying features from each other, it’s doubtful that anyone is actually going to learn anything from this. </p>
<p>In a statement to <em>TechCrunch</em>, WhatsApp noted that the new About Status feature should be rolling out to Android users in the next week, and to iOS users “soon.” </p>      <div>
