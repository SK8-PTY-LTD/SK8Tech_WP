  <p>There are few things I enjoy more than finding a good deal, and each week I’m going to help you find the best tech deals on the internet. Why? Because it’s been a long week and you deserve it. Also why: who doesn’t like a good deal? Name one person who doesn’t. I’ll wait.</p>
<p>Whether you’re in the market for a new computer, camera, drone, or perhaps a 3D illusion lamp of BB-8 Droid — we’ve got you covered. This week there are lots of good ones; the most notable deal is this Dell Multi-Touch Notebook for $1,679, a deal exclusive to <em>The Verge</em> until March 22nd. There’s also a couple sales ending today that you might want to act fast on, including an Amazon Fire Bundle, $100 off the iPad Pro, and $200 off the Samsung 58-inch LED HDTV.</p>
