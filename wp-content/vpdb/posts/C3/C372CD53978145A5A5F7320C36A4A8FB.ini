AON3D makes a $15,000 3D printer that costs just $15 per pound of materials that it says can outperform traditional $150,000 3D printers with more pricey materials. It uses Peek, a revolutionary plastic it says is as strong as metal. It’s already shipped 33 printers and booked $450,000 in revenue with 60% margins. By making 3D printing 10X cheaper, AON3D can move from printers for prototyping into the $30 billion full-scale industrial manufacturing market.</p><p><img src=\"<<[site-url]>>/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/The-52-startups-that-launched-at-Y-Combinator-W17-Demo-Day-1.jpg\" width=\"680\" height=\"680\" srcset=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/aon3d.jpg?w=680&amp;h=680 680w, https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/aon3d.jpg?w=150&amp;h=150 150w, https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/aon3d.jpg?w=300&amp;h=300 300w, https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/aon3d.jpg 743w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" alt=\"The 52 startups that launched at Y Combinator W17 Demo Day 1\"></p><p> </p><p><strong>Pantheon – Letting anyone make a VR game</strong></p><p>Building game in VR typically takes a long time, so it’s hard to test out different game mechanics to find something fun to play.

Kangpe combines telemedicine with health insurance to make premiums cheaper. When someone thinks they’re sick, they connect with a doctor via the Kangpe app or SMS. 70% don’t end up needing to go to a hospital, and the 30% that do are covered by Kangpe’s insurance. It already has the telemedicine app and is now building out its network of local clinics. Since big insurers can’t adapt to telemedicine fast enough, Kangpe could win lots of business in the $5 billion a year health insurance market in Africa, and thinks it can grow that market to $20 billion by being more affordable.</p><p>Read more about Kangpe on TechCrunch</p><p><img src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/k<a href=\">app</a>1.png?w=400&#038;h=400\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/kapp1.png 400w, https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/kapp1.png?w=150&amp;h=150 150w, https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/kapp1.png?w=300&amp;h=300 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" alt=\"The 52 startups that launched at Y Combinator W17 Demo Day 1\"></p><p><strong>Dost Education – Making literacy affordable</strong></p><p>There are 150 million illiterate women in India who have trouble educating their children, leading to a cycle of illiteracy.

There are 900 million mobile phones in Africa and people hardly install new apps but 90% of payments happen offline. Not because they don’t have phones but because most solutions “suck,” according to the founder. Using Kudi, people send a message they want the money to move from one place to another and Kudi will process the request. The company launched in January 2017 and is growing 70% weekly. It has also partnered with Nigeria’s largest bank with more than 10 million customers in a $12 billion market in Nigeria alone. The team also seems to know their stuff when it comes to banking and technology as it is a bunch of fintech experts working in Europe and Africa for the last 5 years.</p><p><img src=\"<<[site-url]>>/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/The-52-startups-that-launched-at-Y-Combinator-W17-Demo-Day-1-18.png\" width=\"1024\" height=\"453\" srcset=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/screen-shot-2017-03-20-at-5-38-24-pm.png?w=1024&amp;h=453 1024w, https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/screen-shot-2017-03-20-at-5-38-24-pm.png?w=150&amp;h=66 150w, https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/screen-shot-2017-03-20-at-5-38-24-pm.png?w=300&amp;h=133 300w, https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/screen-shot-2017-03-20-at-5-38-24-pm.png?w=768&amp;h=339 768w, https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/screen-shot-2017-03-20-at-5-38-24-pm.png?w=680&amp;h=301 680w, https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/screen-shot-2017-03-20-at-5-38-24-pm.png 1206w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" alt=\"The 52 startups that launched at Y Combinator W17 Demo Day 1\"></p><p> </p><p><strong>Upkeep Maintenance Management – Maintenance software for small to medium businesses</strong></p><p>Upkeep is designed to keep technicians happy by creating easier solutions including simple barcode scanning applications, task management, and inventory management accessible through a mobile device.

However, Upkeep works by snapping a picture and taking notes as technicians are out in the field, eliminating the need to write it down several times. It is cash-flow positive and has over 300 paying customers, 95% of which came in organically.
