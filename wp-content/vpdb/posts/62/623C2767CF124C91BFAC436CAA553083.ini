Beyond spelling out the cause of the overheating problem in its popular phone, the company unveiled an eight-point battery check system it said  surpassed industry practices, and it invited rivals to follow its model. </p><p>The upcoming Galaxy S8 was among the first phones to go through the new process. </p><p>\"This is another opportunity to definitely increase the level of standard of excellence regarding lithium ion batteries, not just for Samsung, but throughout the entire industry,\" D.J. Koh, Samsung's mobile chief, said in an interview in January, touting the system as a potential global standard.</p>

        </div>                        <p>But two months after the introduction, what's the industry response? A collective shrug.</p><p>Interviews with phone makers and carriers found that while all placed a high priority on safety, few would talk specifically about Samsung's new battery check process or the idea of adopting it for themselves. Many expressed confidence that the processes they had in place were already sufficient.</p><p>Thanks to the Note 7, the explosive nature of lithium ion batteries is once again a fresh worry for consumers. Overheating batteries were behind all those hoverboards catching fire, and even temporarily delayed the rollout of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner. Apple, too, apple-blames-iphone-battery-fires-on-external-factors/\">dealt with battery fires</a>, even if it blamed the cause on external damage. For Samsung, the world's largest phone maker, the recall was one heck of a black eye.</p><figure section=\"shortcodeImage\"><div data-open=\"modal\" data-target=\"#491e2c28-6663-4547-92c8-58f293b7bc64\" data-component=\"modalEnlargeImage\"><span><img src=\"<<[site-url]>>/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/20170325_58d68b03d2529.jpg\" alt=\"As Galaxy S8 launches, did Note 7 blowup change anything?

</div><p>The carriers themselves were hesitant to talk about Samsung and safety in the same sentence.</p><p>\"We are going to ask handset makers to validate that all the testing they do is in compliance with all safety standards.\" AT&amp;T Chief Technology Officer John Donovan said in an interview in February. \"Absolutely we're sensitive, given the recent issues.\"</p><h3>A 'massive' problem</h3><p>It's easy to understand why companies may be gun-shy when talking about this issue. After all, exploding phones could prove harmful to consumers -- a nightmare scenario. Another issue is the sheer amount of resources it would take to guarantee the safety of products.</p><p>When Samsung worked to figure out the cause behind the Note 7 fires, it had 700 engineers working at four new facilities it built in South Korea, Vietnam and China. They tested more than 200,000 phone units and over 30,000 standalone batteries.</p><figure section=\"shortcodeImage\"><div data-open=\"modal\" data-target=\"#9c8f18ca-6891-4bfa-8fef-ac05c898267c\" data-component=\"modalEnlargeImage\"><span><img src=\"<<[site-url]>>/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/20170325_58d68b06a5ec1.jpg\" alt=\"As Galaxy S8 launches, did Note 7 blowup change anything?

     </aside><p>The other issue is the lack of an agreed-upon standard.

But it felt  comfortable that proper safety measures were in place.</p><p>Overall, there needs to be more transparency in the supply chain on the processes in place, said Holger Kunz, an electrical engineer for TUV Rheinland, another firm that conducted an investigation into the Note 7 and that certifies electronics. He said said device makers shouldn't just trust their suppliers' tests. </p><p>\"A consumer automatically thinks it's the full responsibility of a phone manufacturer,\" Kunz said. \"But a mobile phone manufacturer also expects its battery manufacturer is making good batteries.\"</p><p>Experts hope more companies adopt the eight-point test. But it comes down to how much appetite for risk each vendor can tolerate -- and how deep its pockets are. </p><p>Samsung is lucky that its phones didn't cause a more serious incident. It also still has its share of hardcore fans. Joseph Jugos, for instance, is a Note 7 user who ended up downgrading to a Note 5 while he waits for the next iteration of the phone. The next company to deal with exploding batteries may not be so fortunate, putting consumers in jeopardy of bodily harm -- or worse.</p><p>\"If you're a phone maker, you should be thinking this could happen to me too,\" Ceder said. \"Any other attitude would be really callous, really dangerous.\"</p><p><em>CNET's Alfred Ng contributed to this report.</em></p><p><strong>Updated at 6:49 a.m. PT:</strong> <em>To include a response from Samsung. </em></p>
