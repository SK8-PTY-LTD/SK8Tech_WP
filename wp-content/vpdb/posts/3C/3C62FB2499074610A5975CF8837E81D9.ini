The game will obviously hone your pitch skills, although at the more non-serious end of things.</p><p><img src=\"<<[site-url]>>/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/20170222_58ad301ef1c8a.jpg\" alt=\"Dick Costolo joins Maybe Capital — a new satirical board game about Valley VC\"></p><p>You’ll encounter Steve Jobs, who, guru-like, will advise you, and stop in places like Marin to “smoke pot with someone famous” (and pick up their $5 million investment).</p><p>After various twists and turns, you’ll win the game when you get your portfolio of startups to an IPO first. Alternatively, if a player suddenly secures $50 million in a Series A round, they can declare that the bubble is clearly about to burst and winter is coming…</p><p><img src=\"<<[site-url]>>/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/20170222_58ad3020b032e.jpg\" alt=\"Dick Costolo joins Maybe Capital — a new satirical board game about Valley VC\"></p><div><div></div></div><p>There’s also an interesting online component. Kickstarter backers will get expansion packs and other benefits uploaded to the Maybe Capital site.</p><p>But there’s also a slightly serious side: There’s different pricing for men and women, to highlight the disparity in earning power in the Valley.</p><p><img src=\"<<[site-url]>>/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/20170222_58ad303213474.png\" alt=\"Dick Costolo joins Maybe Capital — a new satirical board game about Valley VC\"></p><p>Maybe Capital was started by Rick Powers, Dre Koval and Anya Kandel, who all have variously worked in Valley startups.</p><p>Tweet a pitch to Koval and at the end of the campaign, the winner will get 1 percent equity of Maybe Capital the board game.</p><p>“What the Maybe Capital team figured out is that Silicon Valley isn’t really about doing something, it’s about starting a conversation so other people can do something,” says another backer, Michael Fertik, executive chairman of Reputation.</p><p>And what does Costolo say? “I wouldn’t say this is a terrible idea.”</p><p>Silicon Valley, huh. Changing the world through board games…</p>"
