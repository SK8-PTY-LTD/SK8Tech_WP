Essentially, the underlying markets that currently exist for trading bitcoin aren’t regulated enough to responsibly support an ETF that would rely on those markets for liquidity.</p><div><div></div></div><blockquote>
<div title=\"Page 2\">

<div>
<p>As discussed further below, the Commission is disapproving this proposed rule change because it does not find the proposal to be consistent with Section 6(b)(5) of the Exchange Act, which requires, among other things, that the rules of a national securities exchange be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices and to protect investors and the public interest.</p>
<p>The Commission believes that, in order to meet this standard, an exchange that lists and trades shares of commodity-trust exchange-traded products (“ETPs”) must, in addition to other applicable requirements, satisfy two requirements that are dispositive in this matter. First, the exchange must have surveillance-sharing agreements with significant markets for trading the underlying commodity or derivatives on that commodity. And second, those markets must be regulated. – the SEC</p>

</blockquote><p>Tyler Winklevoss released a statement via email to Forbes: “We remain optimistic and committed to bringing COIN [the ETF’s proposed ticker] to market, and look forward to continuing to work with the SEC staff. We began this journey almost four years ago, and are determined to see it through. We agree with the SEC that regulation and oversight are important to the health of any marketplace and the safety of all investors.”</p><p>While there are two more bitcoin ETF applications still in a review period, the outlook isn’t good. This is because it seems that the regulators didn’t take issue with the Winklevoss application, they were just concerned with the lack of regulation surrounding bitcoin in general . This lack of regulation is an issue that will stay around either until bitcoin markets mature enough to implement regulations consistent with existing markets that trade other commodities or derivatives, or until the Exchange Act’s laws are changed or altered to provide an exception for bitcoin.</p>"
