	<p>When you imagine your website&rsquo;s visitors, what do you see? Small business owners? Local homeowners? Impatient clickers?</p><p>If your visitors are anything like other people on the web, they&rsquo;re almost certainly in that third group: the impatient crowd. These folks&nbsp;expect your site to load in the blink of an eye. If it doesn&rsquo;t, they&rsquo;re gone -- maybe never to return.</p><p>Now, I&rsquo;m not saying your clients are bad people. Our natural frustration with waiting for a page to load doesn&rsquo;t mean we&rsquo;re overly demanding&nbsp;or even particularly stressed-out. It&rsquo;s just . . . normal behavior.</p><p><strong>Related:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/243350\" target=\"_blank\">Why a Good User Experience Is the Most Overlooked SEO Strategy</a></strong></p><p>Fact is,&nbsp;slow pages are a drag. Nobody likes them. If people think they can find a faster page, or they can get the information faster, the average web users among them&nbsp;will click away -- fast.</p><p>How fast? Two to three&nbsp;seconds, depending on which research you cite.</p><p><a href=\"https://blog.kissmetrics.com/loading-time/\" target=\"_blank\">According to Kissmetrics</a>, 47 percent&nbsp;of consumers expect a page to load in two seconds or less. Kissmetrics&#39; <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/services/seo-sem/\" title=\"Analytics\" target=\"_blank\">Analytics</a>&nbsp;say that 40 percent&nbsp;of consumers will abandon a website that takes more than three seconds to load.</p><p>This impatience doesn&rsquo;taffect just how quickly people will bounce off a page if it doesn&rsquo;t load promptly. It has downright devastating affects on conversion rates&nbsp;too.</p><p>In fact, just a one-second delay in page load time can cut conversions by <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/1825005/how-one-second-could-cost-amazon-16-billion-sales\" target=\"_blank\">7 percent</a>. Amazon&nbsp;discovered this a few years ago. For that megasite, every extra second it takes a page to load costs the company an estimated $1.6 billion dollars in sales each year.&nbsp;Of course, a typical small business website won&rsquo;t suffer penalties like that. But who wants to lose 7 percent&nbsp;of leads or sales to something so simple and so fixable?</p><p>If users like fast pages so much, and it influences their behavior this strongly, is it any surprise that search engines care about it, too?&nbsp;The answer is no, which is why the swiftness with which&nbsp;pages load <a href=\"https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2010/04/using-site-speed-in-web-search-ranking.html\" target=\"_blank\">affects search rankings</a>. It&rsquo;s not the strongest ranking signal, but it matters.</p><p><strong>Related:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/270067\" target=\"_blank\">Here&#39;s What Really Matters for SEO in 2016</a></strong></p><p>Despite this importance of website speed,&nbsp;most small businesses have no plans for making any improvements. According to Clutch&#39;s&nbsp;<em><a href=\"https://clutch.co/web-designers/resources/small-business-websites-2016-survey\" target=\"_blank\">Small Business Websites in 2016</a></em>&nbsp;survey, only 21 percent&nbsp;-- about one in five -- of&nbsp;small businesses surveyed said they planned on improving their website&rsquo;s performance.</p><p>While that&rsquo;s a bit discouraging, it can be good news for you: This is a prime opportunity to get ahead of your competition.</p><p>First thing to do? See how fast your site is right now. <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/\" target=\"_blank\">Google&rsquo;s free PageSpeed Insights</a> tool will give you a pretty detailed analysis in less than a minute.&nbsp;The tool gives you a report for both mobile and desktop users.</p><p>Want a second opinion on how fast your site is? Try <a href=\"https://tools.pingdom.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Pingdom&rsquo;s free tool</a>.&nbsp;Some of these PageSpeed reports will look&nbsp;a bit advanced because, well,they are.&nbsp;If you are, in fact, pretty technical, there&rsquo;s a good how-to article on how to<a href=\"https://moz.com/blog/how-to-achieve-100100-with-the-google-page-speed-test-tool\" target=\"_blank\"> take those results and improve them</a>.</p><p>The rest of us can do our part by keeping image sizes small&nbsp;and hosting our sites on speedy servers. Beyond that, it might be a good idea to hire a <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/services/company-website/\" title=\"web developer\" target=\"_blank\">web developer</a> -- or a technically savvy web designer to optimize your site speed. This person will be able to&nbsp;do&nbsp;in a few hours what it would take most of us days or even weeks to learn.</p><p>If you&#39;re unsure if a designer is worth the investment, consider what&nbsp;even a 10 percent&nbsp;boost in traffic&nbsp;to your website over the next year could be worth to you. Would it be worth less than the cost of hiring someone to do this work? If &quot;no,&quot; then maybe that&rsquo;s a good investment.</p><p>Given that we know that increasing profits&nbsp;is a top challenge for <a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/269972\" target=\"_blank\">45 percent</a>&nbsp;of small business owners, this seems like at least one way to get there.</p><p><strong>Related:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/281485\" target=\"_blank\">9 Overlooked Ways to Make Visitors Love Your Website</a></strong></p><p>So, of course website speed matters. And improving it could help your business a lot. While you may have to hire a <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/services/company-website/\" title=\"website developer\" target=\"_blank\">website developer</a> or designer to help speed up your site, you&rsquo;ll probably earn your money back -- fast.</p>
