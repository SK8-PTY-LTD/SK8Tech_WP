</div><p>Twitter Counter, which is owned by the same parent company as tech blog The Next Web*, confirmed the issue. It said that it had issued a block on the ability to post tweets from its service to nullify the threat.</p><div><div></div></div><p>“One thing is important to note — we do not store users’ Twitter account credentials (passwords) nor credit card information,” Twitter Counter CEO Omer Ginor added.</p><p>In addition to that, Twitter confirmed that it had taken action on its side.</p><p>“We identified an issue affecting a small number of users. Source was a 3rd party <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/tag/app/\" title=\"App\">App</a> and it has been resolved. No action needed by users,” the company said in a statement.</p><p>The incident is a reminder that despite all of the options for securing a Twitter account, apps and services that connect to the social network offer a route for hackers to compromise users. That was the case here. If you’re a Twitter user who connected many services to your account, then it may be worth reviewing or disconnecting them via this setting applications\">here</a> to avoid potential issues in the future.</p><p><em>*Disclaimer: The author of this post was previously employed by The Next Web</em></p><small>Featured Image: Vdovichenko Denis/Shutterstock</small>"
