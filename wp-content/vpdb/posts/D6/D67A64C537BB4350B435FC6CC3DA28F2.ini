A recent Nielsen Scarborough study found that more than </span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">169 million U.S. adults</span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> now read newspapers every month, in print, online or mobile. That’s almost 70 percent of the population.   </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">The New York Times picked up </span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">130,000 new subscribers</span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> last November — 10 times their average monthly growth rate. Subscriptions at </span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">The Wall Street Journal </span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">spiked 300 percent</span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">, the LA Times </span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">went up 61 percent</span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> and Vanity Fair picked up </span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">13,000 new subscriptions in one day</span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">.</span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> The now-profitable Washington Post is hiring </span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">60 new writers.</span> <span style=\"font-weight:400;\">NPR recently said that </span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Big Newspapers Are Booming.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Sure, those papers can thank the incoming president for some of their new business, but this isn’t just a political story. All sorts of reader-supported publishers are enjoying a resurgence.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">In the technology industry, for example, Jessica Lessin’s sharp, pointed (and subscription-only) </span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">The Information</span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> now has the</span> <span style=\"font-weight:400;\">second largest team</span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> of tech reporters in Silicon Valley</span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">. Ben Thompson has several thousand readers who are happy to pay him $100 a year for his excellent Stratechery newsletter. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Why are readers and publishers alike embracing paid subscriptions for content services over ad-based business models? There are several reasons, but the dismal state of online advertising is a big one. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">People hate ads. More than </span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">80 million Americans will use ad blockers this year</span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">, costing digital media companies around $10 billion in revenue. And despite all the media industry talk about relevant “native advertising,” most of us are still drowning in pop-ups. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">It says a lot about advertising that many publishers are pitching its </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">complete absence</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> as a way of incentivizing paid subscriptions. Even Google is doing it — take a look at YouTube Red. Ads have all sorts of other insidious effects, like turning content providers into clickbait factories. Ex-Politico president Jim VandeHei calls it the</span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> “crap trap.”</span></p><div><blockquote>Given that ads are terrible, and that ad revenue is notoriously inconsistent, what else is going on?</blockquote></div><p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Ev Williams recently touched on this when he </span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">announced</span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> the staff shakeup</span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> at Medium: “We had started scaling up the teams to sell and support products that were, at best, incremental improvements on the ad-driven publishing model, not the transformative model we were aiming for. To continue on this trajectory put us at risk</span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">  — </span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">even if we were successful, business-wise — </span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">of becoming an extension of a broken system.” </span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Not surprisingly, Ev recently announced that Medium will be launching a consumer subscription product this summer. </span></p><div><div></div></div><p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Given that ads are terrible, and that ad revenue is notoriously inconsistent, what else is going on? </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">At the same time that publishers are giving the broken ad system a hard look, there’s a whole new generation of consumers who are comfortable subscribing for services — Spotify, Netflix, food boxes, productivity apps — as long as they stay timely, relevant and focused. </span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">A quarter of millennials now read newspapers on a regular basis. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">“The number of people with access to the Internet is huge and lots of niches are underserved right now because they’re not broad enough for advertisers to care about,” </span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">says Ben Thompson</span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">All successful subscription services, from Adobe to Dollar Shave Club to the Weekly Standard, can take advantage of predictable recurring revenue to stay razor-focused on their audiences, create distinctive new features (The New York Times now has a sizeable revenue stream just from its crossword app) and avoid the commodification crap trap.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">As Jessica Lessin says:</span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> “</span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">I still believe it’s much safer to build a business that doesn’t need any advertising to survive. Doing so forces you to focus 100% on your value to your readers. It’s the only way to make sure that what the news publishers deliver to readers in the future is smarter, more informed and more relevant than in the past.”</span></p><div>  <h2>Related Articles</h2>       Pew: younger people actually prefer reading the news to watching it      Why the advertising industry needs to embrace AdBlock      Medium lays off 50 employees, shuts down New York and D.C. offices  </div><p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Sure, advertising is never going to go away, but as subscription services become the norm, readers and publishers alike are starting to appreciate the dividends of a direct consumer relationship. </span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">The behavioral insight that comes with membership plans and paywalls helps newspapers move away from empty calories like slideshow page views toward more valuable engagement metrics like time spent. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Making advertising a secondary — though still vital — revenue source is the most important strategic goal for most news publishers,” </span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">says Ken Doctor of Newsonomics</span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">. “Reader revenue, if backed by sufficient high-quality content and good digital products, proves far more stable than advertising.” </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Of course, the newspaper industry still faces headwinds as it shifts from a print ad model to one largely driven by digital subscriptions, but today’s consumers are increasingly comfortable with supporting smart services of all kinds. And that’s good news for a healthy, independent press.</span></p><small>Featured Image: selimaksan/Getty Images</small>"
