And it was funny and terrifying and heartbreaking and powerful, and that's just skimming the surface.</p><p>  There is so much to unpack when you watch the show -- and that is a testament to the love and dedication of the writers, the cast and the crew.</p><figure section=\"shortcodeImage\"><span><span><img src=\"<<[site-url]>>/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/20170313_58c6b255f10f9.jpg\" alt=\"For 'Buffy' at 20, Amber Benson conjures teen witch memories        As &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; turns 20, the actor talks about her role as the shy witch Tara whose kiss with girlfriend Willow made TV history.\" height=\"0\" width=\"970\" data-original=\"        https://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/img/gcqlyXUDh02nPTGiXKzYMVC3MiQ=/fit-in/970x0/2017/03/10/59598f84-d903-4eec-8d63-7cb77771cd9b/tarawillow1.jpg\"></span><noscript><span itemprop=\"image\" itemscope itemtype=\"https://schema.org/ImageObject\"><img src=\"<<[site-url]>>/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/tarawillow1.jpg\" height=\"0\" width=\"970\" alt=\"For 'Buffy' at 20, Amber Benson conjures teen witch memories        As &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; turns 20, the actor talks about her role as the shy witch Tara whose kiss with girlfriend Willow made TV history.\"><meta itemprop=\"url\" content=\"https://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/img/gcqlyXUDh02nPTGiXKzYMVC3MiQ=/fit-in/970x0/2017/03/10/59598f84-d903-4eec-8d63-7cb77771cd9b/tarawillow1.jpg\"><meta itemprop=\"height\" content=\"0\"><meta itemprop=\"width\" content=\"970\"></span></noscript></span><figcaption><span><p>The romance between Tara (Amber Benson) and Willow (Alyson Hannigan) on \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" set the bar for how to positively portray LGBTQ relationships on TV shows. </p></span><span>

Why is it  important to remember how groundbreaking the series was?</strong><br> Benson: <strong> </strong>It's easy to forget the past ... but when we do, we are doomed to repeat it. Buffy helped give a voice to the LGBTQ conversation that was happening in our country.</p><p>  It showed a positive representation of LGTBQ relationships that was both beautiful and very real. I truly believe Tara and Willow helped to open many closed minds.</p><p>  Celebrating Buffy helps us remember how far we have come and what a tragic step backward it would be to lose the ground we have gained.</p><p> <strong>What drew you to your character Tara?<br></strong>Benson: I loved her shyness and her innate goodness. She saw the good in everyone -- even Spike.</p><p> <strong>What was your favorite moment working with Joss Whedon?</strong><br> Benson: When he gave me the CD with all the songs for the Buffy musical and I heard \"Under Your Spell.\" I was like, \"Really?!? For me?!\" *sigh of happiness*</p><p> <strong>Which episode was your favorite and why?</strong><br> Benson: I'm a sucker for the musical. It was so much work, but I loved every second of it ... and the finished product is magical.</p><p> <strong>Why will being on Buffy always be special for you?</strong><br> Benson: I was a kid, barely in my twenties and it changed my whole world. Playing Tara is probably the thing I am most proud of as an actor. That storyline was so important and I was honored to get to play a part in it.</p><p>  Twenty years makes me feel old! Funny though, it all seems like it happened yesterday.</p><p> <em>Editors' note:<strong> </strong>Benson continues  acting in and producing films and TV series, including developing a TV pilot about female serial killers that she's writing now. \"Buffy\" fans might be excited to know she also has a  successful career as an author of urban fantasy books that not surprisingly include entertaining tales about witches. Her next book, \"The End of Magic,\" comes out this May.<br></em></p>
