Just three months later, it was back to confess that a separate incident store account information belonging to one billion users.

Verizon originally agreed to pay $4.8 billion for the company, but it is reportedly seeking a $1 billion discount after details of the hackings came to light. An SEC investigation is sure to heap further pressure on. Already, the news has sent Yahoo’s share price down.</p><div data-width=\"600\" data-height=\"526\" data-widget-id=\"iupMbG2i405\" data-frozen=\"true\" data-href=\"http://listings.findthecompany.com/l/19200951/Yahoo-Inc-in-Sunnyvale-CA\">    FindTheCompany | Graphiq  </div><p>The SEC has investigated companies for the way they have disclosed hacks in the past, but it is yet to take action.
