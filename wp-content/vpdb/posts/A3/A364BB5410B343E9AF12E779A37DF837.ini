Up front you'll find spots for all your mobile charging needs: four USB ports (two with Quick Charge 2.0), two USB Type C with Quick Charge 3.0 and two DC outlets. Around back you'll find two AC outlets and a 12-volt car port.</p><p> 	 I had a chance to test an early sample and, while I did no formal battery testing, it seems to perform as promised, powering and charging up to 11 devices simultaneously for hours. It was a perfect companion for everything from car camping trips to home improvement work to keeping my drone and GoPro batteries charged up while I was out flying for the day.</p><div section=\"shortcodeGallery\">

            </div>
            </div><p> 	 That amount of power also meant I could go work on my laptop out in park for hours with my screen on full brightness without worrying about finding an outlet or my phone battery dying while I used it as a mobile hotspot. And while using it outdoors or on the go is a given, I also found myself using it around the house in lieu of an extension cord.</p><p> 	 Also, because the thing weighs around 11 pounds (5 kg), it wasn't too much of hassle to carry around  and the display on front lets you know just how much power you're using and the time remaining. What really sells the River, though, is that it'll make a great emergency power source since it doesn't trickle discharge as quickly as competing stations. EcoFlow claims it will keep a full charge for one year, so it'll be ready whenever you need to use it.</p>

If you're traveling, a car lighter socket will get it fully charged in 9 hours. EcoFlow also offers an optional solar panel that will take the River from empty to full in 10 to 15 hours.</p><figure section=\"shortcodeImage\"><span><span><img src=\"<<[site-url]>>/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/20170513_5916783b4d961.jpg\" alt=\"EcoFlow River is a mobile power plant for all your gear        This slick-looking battery could change how and where you work and play.\" data-original=\"https://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/img/Xhe4Wx1Prms7ylHs-06lorwU3YA=/2017/05/12/ab283a44-548d-42ec-997b-84e259f68189/ecoflow-river-45.jpg\"></span><noscript><span itemprop=\"image\" itemscope itemtype=\"https://schema.org/ImageObject\"><img src=\"<<[site-url]>>/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecoflow-river-45.jpg\" alt=\"EcoFlow River is a mobile power plant for all your gear        This slick-looking battery could change how and where you work and play.\"><meta itemprop=\"url\" content=\"https://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/img/Xhe4Wx1Prms7ylHs-06lorwU3YA=/2017/05/12/ab283a44-548d-42ec-997b-84e259f68189/ecoflow-river-45.jpg\"></span></noscript></span><figcaption><span><p>The River isn't water sealed, but an optional $59 case helps protect it from the elements. </p></span><span>

It is fully funded and the company says its already getting the power stations ready to ship the first units out to backers with shipments expected to arrive in June and July (though UK, Australia, EU versions shipping with 220-230V 50Hz AC output and a universal plug won't ship till September).</p>
