A listing in that price range would give the company a valuation that’s just shy of $12 billion, not to mention it would represent Korea’s most lucrative listing since 2010.</p><p>Netmarble said the money raised will be used to pay off debts, invest in R&amp;D and pursue investments and acquisitions. Founder Bang Jun-hyuk previously told Reuters he wants to make the company a top five game publisher by 2020. The company counts Chinese giant Tencent, owner of Supercell, among its investor base courtesy of a $500 million investment in 2014. It recently scooped up most of U.S.-based Kabam’s assets in a deal valued around $700 million and a history of global M&amp;A activity.</p><div><div></div></div><p>For its most recent financial year, Netmarble reported a net profit of 209 billion won ($187 million) on total sales of 1.5 trillion won ($1.34 billion). That revenue figure was up 40 percent year-on-year, with net profit improving from around $150 million in 2015.</p><p>Established in 2000, the company is both a game developer and a publisher. Its partners include Disney and it has a direct presence in more than seven countries worldwide, including the U.S., Japan, Turkey, Indonesia, China and Thailand. Analytics and tracking firm appannie.com/insights/app-annie-news/app-annie-52-top-app-publishers-2016/\">App Annie ranked Netmarble</a> as the world’s ninth largest app publisher based on revenue from mobile in 2016. Its most popular titles include role player game series Lineage, Marvel: Future Fight, StoneAge, and Seven Knights.</p><small>Featured Image: Rrraum/Shutterstock</small>"
