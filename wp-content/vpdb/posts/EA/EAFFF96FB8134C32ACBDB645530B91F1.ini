  <p>Google is adding some handy features to Maps that’ll make it easier to remember where you left your car.</p>
<p>In the app’s apps/testing/com.google.android.apps.maps\">latest beta</a> apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.maps&amp;hl=en\">on Android</a>, you’re able to tap on the little blue dot that represents you to pull up the option to leave a parking reminder. Doing so will open a screen that lets you enter notes and capture photos to help you remember the specific spot your car is in — helpful for huge lots or multi-story garages. The app also lets you include how much time is remaining on the spot, and it’ll set a timer to keep you from running over.</p>
<div><aside><q>Google is actually behind Apple on this</q></aside></div>
<p>The downside is that none of this is automated. While Google does have some automated parking reminders, you’ll have to go through this process inside Maps if you really want to make sure the there’s a reminder on your phone.</p>
<p>This is also a rare instance where Google is playing a little bit of catch-up to Apple. Apple Maps gained parking reminders last year, and it’s able to provide them without any input from users. Apple Maps includes a spot to attach notes and a photo, too.</p>      <div>
        
<div data-cb-dfp-id=\"unit=mobile_article_body\" data-cb-ad-id=\"Mobile article body\">
  
</div>

      </div>

<p>For now, this feature is just inside the beta version of Google Maps on Android. Chances are, that means it’ll hit the public version soon and expand to iOS around the same time.</p>
