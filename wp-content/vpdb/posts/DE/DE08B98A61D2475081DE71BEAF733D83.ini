He said that if he’d still been at Mode, the shutdown would have played out differently — rather than leaving creators unpaid and employees without severance.</p><div><div></div></div><p>“I wish we could have been there,” Arora said. “We would have either saved it or dealt with the ending in a much better way.”</p><p><div>

While this company will be launching in many of Mode’s old markets, Arora said it will be pursuing new ideas: “We have no intentions of trying to create another Mode.”</p>"
