        </figure><p>Boston Dynamics has a long history of viral videos showing off its robots. Some of its best known include:</p><ul>
<li>Big Dog - a quadruped robot designed for the US military with funding from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (Darpa)</li>
<li>Petman (Protection Ensemble Test Mannequin)  - a bipedal device constructed for testing chemical protection suits. It is the first anthropomorphic robot that moves dynamically like a real person. Much of its technology is derived from Big Dog</li>
<li>Atlas (Agile Anthropomorphic Robot) - a 6ft (183cm) bipedal robot, based on Boston Dynamics' earlier Petman humanoid robot, and designed for a variety of search and rescue tasks. It is a high mobility, humanoid robot designed to negotiate rough outdoor terrain</li>
<li>Handle - a research robot on wheels that stands 6.5ft (198cm) tall, travels at 9mph (14.5km/h) and jumps 4ft (122cm) vertically. It uses electric power to operate both electric and hydraulic actuators, with a range of about 15 miles (24km) on one battery charge. </li>
