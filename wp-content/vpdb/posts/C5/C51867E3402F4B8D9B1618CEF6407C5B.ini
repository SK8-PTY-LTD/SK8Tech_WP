        </figure><p>Emma Sinclair MBE, tech entrepreneur and investor, said she admired their ambition but was \"unconvinced\" that the platform could live up to the family's expectations.</p><p>\"Sports fans are already likely using one or more of Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and SnapChat. That's in addition to text, Whatsapp, email. And they will no doubt have their favourite sports hubs too relating to teams they support and commentators they follow,\" she said.</p><p>\"There's a lot of competition and noise out there and for a start-up on a small budget, competing with giants and established players for attention is an expensive and ambitious job. </p><p>\"As an angel investor and with the little information I have to hand, I am currently unconvinced that this site has the capacity to disrupt the market and come out on top as a key hub for sports fans as things stand. </p><p>\"This being a site in beta however, I hope they prove me wrong and I wish them luck.\"</p>
