                    Matilda Ho suggests silkworms could serve as a source of protein for humans

        </figure><p>Ms Ho began tackling the issue with an online farmers' market which now supplies 240 types of new produce from 57 farmers.</p><p>It has gained 40,000 subscribers since it was launched 18 months ago.</p><p>\"I wanted to use technology to shorten the gap between growers and consumers,\" Ms Ho told the BBC.</p><p>\"It is a right to know where your food comes from and it empowers consumers.\"</p><p>The food is delivered to customers via electric vehicles and in biodegradable boxes to keep the carbon footprint low.</p><p>China has a rapidly rising middle class and a culture where it is polite to over-order food for guests in restaurants.</p><p>Ms Ho realised that one online start-up was not enough and has now launched an accelerator to promote a range of food tech firms.</p><p>It includes a start-up that uses silkworms as a sustainable source of protein.</p><p>\"In China, silkworms are by-products of the textile industry so they are affordable and accessible,\" explained Ms Ho.</p><p>\"They also don't sound like a bug so it doesn't sound as yucky as an insect. As kids we raised silkworms at school.\"</p><p>There is a history of insect eating in China but silkworms are the only insect currently legal in China to use as an ingredient in food. </p><p>There is a push to legalise crickets too but that is likely to take three to five years to become law.</p>
