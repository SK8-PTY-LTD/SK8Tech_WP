  <p>Today, scientists on Twitter discovered an important technique that could very well give them an edge in the competitive funding climate: CAPS LOCK. It’s the secret sauce that makes WHATEVER YOU’RE SAYING SO MUCH MORE CONVINCING.</p>
<p>See, doing science takes <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/tag/money/\" title=\"Money\">Money</a> — to pay postdocs and graduate students, for equipment and reagents, even to present and publish results. So in the US, at least, academic researchers are constantly churning out applications for a finite pool of <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/tag/money/\" title=\"Money\">Money</a>. And grants are becoming increasingly competitive, which can make scientists a little loopy from all the pressure. That’s why some of them have started tweeting their requests for funding in all caps, with the hashtag #ALLCAPSPROPOSAL. </p>
<p>Our highly scientific and extremely rigorous investigation on Twitter that started and ended about 30 minutes ago suggests that Julie Blommaert, a graduate student at the University of Innsbruck in Austria, started the hashtag when she forgot to turn off caps lock while writing a proposal. </p>

</div>
<p>Thus, #ALLCAPSPROPOSAL was born. And, it kind of became a thing: </p>      <div>

<p>For what it’s worth, any institution funding this research should also probably also throw in a few bucks for extensive, professional-quality videos of raccoons solving puzzles. And I’m calling dibs for <em>The Verge</em> on the footage of those brilliant little trash pandas and their Rubik’s cubes. DIBS. </p>
