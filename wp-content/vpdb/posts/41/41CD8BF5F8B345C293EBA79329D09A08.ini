Last month the company app.com/2017/02/21/hailo-and-mytaxi-join-forces/\">announced</a> the official launch of mytaxi in London but Hailo users were told to hang fire for further instructions on how to migrate their accounts.</p><p>That migration process is now live, with Hailo app users being directed via a personalized link to download mytaxi — avoiding the need for them to register, login or add account details.</p><div><div></div></div><p>“They are automatically logged in and their Hailo account details will be ready and waiting, meaning they can start hailing cabs straight away,” the company notes today.</p><p>Similarly, the brand merger was announced in another Hailo city, Barcelona, back in app.com/2017/01/26/hailo-y-mytaxi-conductor/\">January</a> but the Hailo app hasn’t yet been switched off there entirely either. But the eventual aim is to consolidate operations across Europe under the mytaxi brand.</p><p>“The next step is to migrate Hailo drivers and passengers in Spain. Once this is complete, the Hailo app will cease to exist,” a spokeswoman for the company confirmed.</p><p>Across Europe, mytaxi has around 100,000 registered drivers whose taxis can be hailed via the app, and is available in more than 50 cities across nine countries — with a tenth country (Greece) due to be added soon after mytaxi acquired local player Taxibeat last month.</p>"
