The latter means that I’ve been unable to test Engie (yes, my car is <em>old</em>).</p><p>Once a specific malfunction is detected, the Engie app will alert local repair shops in its marketplace, who will assess the problem and send back a quote for required work. This also forms the basis for the startup’s business model: it takes a 6 per cent commission on each job booked via the app.</p><div><div></div></div><p>Last June, Yarden Gross, co-founder and CEO of Engie, told me the inspiration for the startup came from his own feeling of being at the mercy of mechanics and the auto industry anytime something went wrong with his car.</p><p>He had no idea if he was being taken for a ride (pun intended) in terms of what he was being told needed repair or the cost of parts. Better technology and a more transparent marketplace — or, more specifically, Engie was the answer.</p><p>Gross also said that, since each manufacturer or car model has different diagnostics interfaces and data points, producing a universal diagnostics card and app is non-trivial, involving a certain amount of reverse-engineering and gleaning of auto industry data.</p><p>Since launching in 2015, the company claims 100,000 registered users and works with 200 mechanics in Israel.</p>"
