So far, 96 percent of the 3 million Note 7 buyers around the world have returned the devices, according to Samsung.</p><p> That would mean there's still an estimated 120,000 Galaxy Note 7s  remaining in the wild. In South Korea, 97 percent of the Galaxy Note 7s have been returned.</p><p> The phone, which earned positive reviews when it released, quickly crashed and burned after it came to light that the device's faulty batteries were overheating and exploding. Samsung issued a recall in September, and then was forced to issue a second recall after the replacement Galaxy Note 7s had the same fiery flaw.</p><p> In January, the company revealed what caused the two battery defects and vowed to improve their product testing to ensure a fiasco like the Galaxy Note 7 wouldn't h<a href=\"<<[site-url]>>\">app</a>en again.</p><p> The move comes just days before Samsung is set to reveal its next flagship phone with the Galaxy S8.</p><p> <em>First published March 24, 9:26 a.m. PT.</em> <br><strong>Update at 10:11 a.m. PT</strong>: <em>To clarify the update is specifically for South Korea.</em></p>
