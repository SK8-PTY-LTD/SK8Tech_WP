But the shoe company also takes a lot of pride in what's on the bottom of its swoosh-adorned footwear. The treads can be viewed as both a symbol of technology (Lunarlon) and works of art. So in some ways, it makes sense that the company would try to leverage its engineering and design efforts into something you don't actually wear on your feet. </p><p>CNET editor and resident sneakerhead Brian Tong didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on whether he's already bought a case.</p>
