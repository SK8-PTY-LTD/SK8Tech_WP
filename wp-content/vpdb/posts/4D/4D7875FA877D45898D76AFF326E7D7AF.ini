	<p>Finding a job is tough. It takes time and effort. You need to pay attention to tiny details, especially in your resume, and make sure everything is flawless.&nbsp;As a candidate if you want to look professional and get noticed among others, you must pay attention to the below nine&nbsp;points in your resume.</p><p><strong>Related:&nbsp;<a data-ga-action=\"headline\" data-ga-category=\"playlist-authorArticles-ceren-cubukcu\" data-ga-label=\"playlist.11\" href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/278407\">How to Adapt Life After College</a></strong></p><h2><strong>Be professional</strong></h2><p>If you want to show that you are professional, your resume should reflect this. There shouldn&rsquo;t be any grammar mistakes or a funny email address. Also, you should use a simple and readable font.</p><h2><strong>Create impact</strong></h2><p>Use the <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/services/seo-sem/\" title=\"Keywords\" target=\"_blank\">Keywords</a> that are on the job description and highlight your key skills and successes. Make sure you have a persuasive profile and a recruiter can quickly match your profile with the job.</p><h2><strong>Easy to read</strong></h2><p>Your resume should be easy to read. Use bullet points, bold headings and clearly divided sections. Recruiters generally only scan resumes and don&rsquo;t read them. They spend less than a minute in one resume.</p><h2><strong>Right length</strong></h2><p>Your resume should be in the right length. It shouldn&rsquo;t be too long or too short. In this&nbsp;<a href=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0453/4797/files/New_6bb9945c-7cf8-40e7-b2aa-8d130b9cd0f3.jpg?6078274002030312840\" target=\"_blank\">infographic</a>, it mentions that it should be under two&nbsp;pages long. However, for the U.S., your resume should be one&nbsp;page long unless you have a Ph.D or at least 7-8 years of experience.</p><p><strong>Related:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/288068\">How to&nbsp;Stay Positive at Work</a></strong></p><h2><strong>Requirements of the job</strong></h2><p>If your skills, knowledge and experience don&rsquo;t reflect the requirements in the job description, then, you need to revise your resume. Don&rsquo;t send the same resume to all of the jobs, tailor it according to the job description and responsibilities</p><h2><strong>Structure</strong></h2><p>Having a structure is important in your resume. You should have a summary section which mentions your key experiences and job roles. Also, don&rsquo;t forget to add your key achievements to your resume.</p><h2><strong>Show your value</strong></h2><p>Employers want to see the return on investment. Therefore, your resume should reflect your value to the potential employer such as &ldquo;I did this and the process improved&rdquo; or &ldquo;I did this and the costs decreased&rdquo;.</p><h2><strong>Include numbers</strong></h2><p>Include numbers in your resume such as I worked with a team of 10 people or I managed a budget of $500.000. In this way, recruiters can have a benchmark point.</p><p><strong>Related:&nbsp;<a data-ga-action=\"headline\" data-ga-category=\"playlist-authorArticles-ceren-cubukcu\" data-ga-label=\"playlist.1\" href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/289672\">Things to Do When Your Job Is at Risk</a></strong></p><h2><strong>Be easy to contact</strong></h2><p>Be reachable and don&rsquo;t forget to include your cell phone number, email address and mailing address at the top of your resume.</p>
