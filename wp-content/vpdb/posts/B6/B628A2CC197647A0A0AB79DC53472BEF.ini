Privacy is sacred; our digital lives can reveal so much about us — our interests, our deepest thoughts, and even who we love. I am thrilled to be working with such an exceptional group of people who share a passion to protect that,” he wrote.</p><div><div></div></div><p>Earlier in his career, Zdziarski worked on jailbreaking iPhones and, in 2014, he raised the issue of backdoors in Apple products. Apple said at the time that the functions Zdziarski identified were “apple-refers-to-ios-back-doors-as-diagnostic-capabilities/\">diagnostic capabilities</a>.” More recently, Zdziarski developed Little Flocker, a security application for macOS.</p><p>Although Apple declined to comment on the hire, it makes sense for the company to bring one of the world’s foremost experts on its products in-house. Zdziarski also declined to comment on the move, but said in his post he’s “very excited to be working with a group of like minded individuals.”</p><small>Featured Image: Bryce Durbin/TechCrunch</small>"
