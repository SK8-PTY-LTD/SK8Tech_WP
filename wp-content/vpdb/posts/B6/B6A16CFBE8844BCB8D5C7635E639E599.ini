This is exactly what is happening with the Nintendo Switch as Nintendo is ramping up production for the next 12 months.</p><p>Nintendo already said that the company was planning to sell 2 million consoles for the month of March. According to SuperData, the company has already sold 1.5 million units with a couple of weeks to spare. It looks like Nintendo will easily beat its launch target.</p><p>In fact, it has become quite hard to buy a Switch. Many stores are waiting for the next batch as they already sold everything. You can still buy it in France on Amazon, but it seems like an exception.</p><p>According to the WSJ, Nintendo is going to produce 16 million units over the next 12 months. The company previously expected to produce 8 million Switches.</p><p>It doesn’t mean that Nintendo is going to sell them all, but it’s a positive sign. The company only sold 13.56 million Wii U in more than four years.</p><div><div></div></div><p>The Switch has a bright future, and it shows that having a successful launch is key when it comes to putting a new console on the market. If you manage to sell a good amount of consoles in the first few months, then third-party developers invest in the platform and release new games.</p><p>It then becomes a virtuous circle, attracting more buyers. Nintendo shares are currently up 4 percent compared to yesterday’s closing price.</p><p>As Nintendo chose to launch the Switch in March, the company should have ironed out everything that is slowing down production for the holiday season. I wouldn’t be surprised if the Switch ends up being one of the most popular gifts for the end of 2017.</p>"
