Phillips Van Heusen (PVH), owner of Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger and Izod, among other iconic brands, has acquired the <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/services/startup-consulting/\" title=\"StartUp\" target=\"_blank\">StartUp</a> and plans to use it to move deeper into online sales and big data <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/services/seo-sem/\" title=\"Analytics\" target=\"_blank\">Analytics</a> connected to that.</p><p>Terms of the deal were not disclosed, but sources with direct knowledge of the deal said investors mostly got their <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/tag/money/\" title=\"Money\">Money</a> back, but nothing more. The deal value was in the “tens of millions.” True&amp;Co had raised a reported $13 million from a strong list of investors that included Crosslink Capital, Cowboy Ventures, First Round, SoftBank, SoftTech VC and the VTF (fomerly the Vegas Tech Fund).</p><p>We’ve reached out to PVH — which has operations in 40 countries and last year made $8 billion in annual revenues — to see if we can get any details or confirmation on the price. We have yet to hear back from PVH. Michelle Lam, the co-founder and CEO of the company, replied to our questions with a short description of today as “an amazing day for the company.”  A True&amp;Co spokesperson declined to give any details on the price but did confirm that the brand would remain.</p><p>In the meantime, PVH’s CEO and chairman, Emanuel Chirico, noted in a statement that the deal underscores the company’s interest in doing more on digital platforms.</p><p>“Today’s announcement illustrates our commitment to driving innovation across our business and demonstrates our commitment to making strategic investments in our digital platforms to support our long-term growth initiatives,” he said. “We believe that we can leverage the <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/services/seo-sem/\" title=\"Analytics\" target=\"_blank\">Analytics</a> tools of this data-driven company, while leveraging PVH’s intimates category expertise, including global brand management, product know-how and supply chain.”</p><p>True&amp;Co., founded in 2012, was one of the earlier movers in the wave of vertically integrated <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/services/e-commerce/\" title=\"E-Commerce\" target=\"_blank\">E-Commerce</a> startups that use technology to move into and disrupt traditionally non-tech areas of business. Others in the world of fashion have included Warby Parker, but you could also count the multitude of on-demand startups like Uber and the Dollar Shave Club among those following the same concept. (Some of course do better than others.)</p><p>Bras are a particularly challenging area because even in a physical retail environment, it can be tricky to get the right fit.</p><p>While some other bra startups, such as ThirdLove, use your cameraphone plus questions to measure and figure out your contours and sizes, True&amp;Co’s model was based on a “bra quiz” that asks you some questions based on a bra that you already own and some basics about how you look.</p><div><div></div></div><p>Using data that it holds about well-known bra brands, and your own feedback on the size that you own, it figures out what would be a good bra for you. It then sends you five bras that fit the bill and you pay for what you want, and send back what you do not.</p><p>It seems that while the company definitely attracted attention — some 5 million women tried out its bra quiz — it’s not clear how many of those actually converted into paying customers.</p><p>Whatever the state of True&amp;Co’s business was by the time of its exit, one interesting opportunity going forward will be in how PVH leverages the <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/services/startup-consulting/\" title=\"StartUp\" target=\"_blank\">StartUp</a>’s platform to help sell its other brands.</p><p>Calvin Klein has an extensive line of underwear, and among PVH’s other holdings are Warner and Olga, two other top names in the world of lingerie, and Speedo, a swimwear and active wear brand. It seems likely that these will either augment or replace True&amp;Co’s existing line of products with these for better economies of scale, or have the True team create True-like experiences for these brands individually.</p><p>In either case, some clear opportunities should arise from the consolidation.</p><p><i>Additional reporting by Katie Roof.</i> </p>"
