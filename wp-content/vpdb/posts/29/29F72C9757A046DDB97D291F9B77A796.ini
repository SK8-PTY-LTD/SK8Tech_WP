</div><p>The New York Times said existence of the Greyball program was confirmed by four current and former Uber employees, who were not named.</p><p>Greyball identified regulators posing as ordinary passengers, by collecting data on the location used when ordering a taxi and determining whether this coincided with government offices.</p><p>It also checked credit card information to establish whether the user is linked to an institution or law enforcement authority.</p><p>Uber, the report adds, even visited phone shops to trace smartphones bought by city officials setting up multiple accounts in an effort to catch the company's drivers.</p><p>Once individuals suspected of attempting to entrap drivers were identified, they would be served a \"fake\" version of the Uber app, with fictitious cabs on view, and where they were successful in ordering a real one, they would have their booking cancelled. Local officials contend this is illegal.</p><hr><h2>Read more</h2><ul>

Just two weeks earlier he apologised for \"abhorrent\" sexism at the company.</p>
