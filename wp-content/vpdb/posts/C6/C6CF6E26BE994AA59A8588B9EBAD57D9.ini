        </div>                        <p>Sure, Samsung makes transferring old messages from an iPhone to a Galaxy phone pretty easy. And that's important. But I'd miss the convenience of iMessage syncing text messages between my phone, Mac and iPad. That's where the real magic happens. On Android, my messages would be trapped like some kind of disheartened wild animal.</p><p>There is Google Voice and third-party apps that can make the Android/Mac message sync possible, but it adds another step to a process that is already seamless with iMessage. And who wants another step? Not me. I just want iMessage.</p><p>Note to self: Maybe this is how people felt leaving behind Blackberry Messenger for an iPhone 10 years ago? Empathy.</p><h3>Will Apple freeze hell again?</h3><p>The idea that Apple would ever let iMessage cross over to Android isn't that crazy.
