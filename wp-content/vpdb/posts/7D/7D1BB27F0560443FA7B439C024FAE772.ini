The company has now revealed an exact date for Mario’s Android debut: March 23. That’s this Thursday, in case you’re bad at math or don’t have a calendar handy, and it means iOS users had over three months of exclusive access to the game.</p><p>Since that’s a virtual eternity in the fast-paced world of mobile gaming, here’s a reminder of what Super Mario Run actually is: Nintendo’s first mobile game leveraging its classic IP.
