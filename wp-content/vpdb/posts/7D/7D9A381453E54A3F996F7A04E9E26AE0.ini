        </div>                        <p>  While consumers would normally ignore something as wonky as Gigabit LTE, carriers are starting to trumpet the technology as a catalyst for their faster networks. T-Mobile CEO John Legere boasted in January that his company would be the first with Gigabit LTE this year, providing a public spotlight to what could have been an obscure technical term.</p><p>  What would the next iPhone presumably miss out on? Gigabit LTE promises a significant speed boost to your phone -- think 18 times faster than the average speeds posted by the likes of T-Mobile and Verizon in a recent test by OpenSignal. With those kinds of speeds, you can say goodbye to buffering as downloads zip by in a flash.</p><p>  Carriers, meanwhile, also want more phones on Gigabit LTE because it makes for a more efficient network better able to handle more users and traffic.</p><p>  Apple, Qualcomm and Intel declined to comment.</p><h3>Repeating history?</h3><p>  Why is this scenario plausible? This has already happened before, according to a apple-iphone-chips-patent-lawsuit/\">legal filing from Qualcomm</a>.</p><p>  Let's rewind things back to the <span section=\"shortcodeLink\">apple-iphone-7/review/\">iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus</a></span>. It marked the first time Apple used two modem suppliers on the device, with Intel modems going into T-Mobile and AT&amp;T iPhones, and Qualcomm modems going into Verizon and Sprint versions.</p><p>  Qualcomm accused Apple of limiting the Qualcomm modems in iPhones so the performance would be on par with the Intel-powered version.</p><figure section=\"shortcodeImage\"><span><span><img src=\"<<[site-url]>>/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/20170427_590219d3c3f79.jpg\" alt=\"iPhone 8 may miss one key feature already in the Galaxy S8        Apple's next flagship phone may be incapable of t<a href=\">app</a>ing into higher speeds offered by wireless carriers.

Its first Gigabit LTE-capable chip, the XMM 7560, hits the market next year.</p><h3>Why it matters</h3><p>  Despite its name, Gigabit LTE doesn't necessarily mean your phone will be able to download cat videos at 1 gigabit per second, which is equivalent to the home broadband connection you would get with Google Fiber. The Gigabit LTE refers to the theoretical peak speed, although the real world average speed is still vastly faster than anything you experience now.</p><blockquote>  <strong>Read more about Gigabit LTE here.</strong> </blockquote><p>  Gigabit LTE networks aren't really up and running in any meaningful market, with only T-Mobile mentioning select areas in a few markets capable of getting those speeds. Chief Technology Officer Neville Ray said in an interview on Monday that he didn't think Gigabit LTE would be available nationwide, but the technology would be one way the company could \"highlight its network superiority.\"</p><p>  But the technology isn't just about bragging rights. As carriers upgrade their networks, your Gigabit LTE-capable phone will get faster and faster. So a phone you buy this year might actually get better in 2018 and beyond.</p><div section=\"shortcodeGallery\">

That's something to consider as you use your phone for the next few years.</p><p>  It's still unclear what Apple will do with the next iPhone. It could just switch back to just using Qualcomm's modem. Or perhaps it will employ the X16 in markets like the US where Gigabit LTE is on its way, with Intel going elsewhere.
