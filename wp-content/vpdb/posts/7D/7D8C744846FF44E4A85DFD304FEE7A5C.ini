According to <em>The</em> <em>Guardian</em>, a 2015 report found that there were 41 million <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/tag/native/\" title=\"Native\">Native</a> Spanish speakers and 11.6 million bilingual Spanish speakers in the United States, making it the second-largest Spanish-speaking country in the world.</p>      <div>
