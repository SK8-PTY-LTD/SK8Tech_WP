<li>allowing characters created by the children to retain their characteristics between sessions</li>
<li>letting pupils take \"photos\" of their progress via an in-game camera, and then store them in an online book alongside their own notes. These can then act as tutorials for other children or be used by the teacher to score their progress</li>
<li>permitting children to download software that will allow them to continue playing the educational version of Minecraft outside school without having to buy their own copy of the game</li>
</ul><p>To access the service, children and teachers each need their own Office 365 ID, which can also be used to provide access to the Microsoft's cloud-based productivity software.</p><figure>
