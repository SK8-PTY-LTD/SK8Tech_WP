Cassie, a new robot from Agility Robotics, is a great example of that: its stable yet precise gait and was based on that of birds — specifically, ostriches.</p><p>Cassie is descended from ATRIAS, another bipedal bot with unique leg motion; but while ATRIAS looks sort of like a naked Dalek, Cassie resembles nothing if not a newborn ED209.</p><p><img src=\"<<[site-url]>>/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Cassie-the-ostrich-bot-does-the-bipedal-robot-chicken-walk.gif\" width=\"480\" height=\"270\" alt=\"Cassie the ostrich bot does the bipedal robot chicken walk\">ATRIAS was built at Oregon State University, which spun off Agility Robotics last year. The basic ideas are similar between the two, but advances in batteries, leg design, and computing make Cassie able to walk with considerably more agility.</p><p>Like ostriches (and humans), Cassie has three degrees of freedom in its hips and flexible, powered ankles, but knees that only flex one way. This creates not only a natural gait, but a way to steer that’s similar to our own. As with ATRIAS, quick and careful placement of the feet makes Cassie resistant to slips, stumbles, and the occasional malicious grad student.</p><p><span style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe type=\"text/html\" width=\"640\" height=\"390\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/5YDIzeW42hg?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p><div><div></div></div><p><div>  <h2>Related Articles</h2>       The Swift is a programmable robotic arm for the masses      Bat Bot is the biomimetic flying soft robot we deserve      Boston Dynamics adds wheels to its already chilling robots  </div>The whole chassis is very lightweight, and is designed to absorb shock in a natural way, as we do when we walk.
