Apparently, that's exactly what Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg did while writing his more than 5,700-word treatise outlining how the social networking company can help save the world.</p><p>\"Progress now requires humanity coming together not just as cities or nations, but also as a global community,\" he wrote in February. </p><p>According to a lengthy profile in New York Times Magazine, Zuck -- as he's called by friends -- worked on the manuscript for weeks and discussed drafts with a cross section of people, including the Times' journalists and President Barack Obama.</p><p>What's interesting of course is that this manifesto and his conversations came at a time when talk of Zuck and politics were at a fever pitch. Some people thought he might be gearing up for an eventual presidential run, maybe even against President Donald Trump in 2020.</p>
