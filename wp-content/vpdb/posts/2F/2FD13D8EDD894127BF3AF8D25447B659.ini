  <p>In what might be this week’s worst new idea, Reuters reports that AMC is working on an ad-free subscription video service that would be exclusively available to cable TV customers. In other words, it’d be a paid service that would be separate from your normal cable bill but <em>require</em> a cable account to even sign up for. </p>
<p>You’d pay extra  — between $4.99 to $6.99 per month (AMC is still finalizing pricing) — on top of your TV bill to get ad-free streaming from whatever this AMC app is. Woof. What are we doing here, people? </p>
<p>Sure, commercials are annoying and definitely pull you out of <em>The Walking Dead</em>, but who would pay to avoid them on a single network? Ad-free Hulu is an appealing thing. This? No thanks. Especially for the prices AMC seems to be considering. For one or two bucks, <em>maybe</em> I could see it. And while I don’t subscribe, CBS All Access at least makes sense from the perspective that cable isn’t a prerequisite to use it. </p>
<p>The Reuters report says that AMC’s as-yet-unannounced service could feature exclusive “digital-only spinoff shows” of existing programs. Yeah, I’d sure that’d be top-notch material. Surefire Emmy contenders. I can’t recall such a blatant attempt to cash in while you’ve still got shows that draw big ratings. </p>      <div>
