It’s also designed to make generating reports, such as those that are required quarterly or yearly, a lot less painful and updatable in real-time.</p><div><div></div></div><p>I’m told that 64,000 businesses already manage their finances on Silverfin, either directly or via an accountancy firm. The latter includes Deloitte, the well-known audit, <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/services/business-consulting/\" title=\"Consulting\" target=\"_blank\">Consulting</a>, tax and advisory firm.</p><p>“Ultimately we’re building a central nervous system for financial advisory and <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/tag/services/\" title=\"Services\">Services</a> firms, paving the way for us to become the first real-time monitor of businesses’ financial data,” says Silverfin co-founder Joris Van Der Gucht in a statement.</p><p>Adds Jan Hammer, partner at Index Ventures: “Fully automating data collection and reconciliation has been described as ‘the holy grail’ of accounting, because it will transform the financial advisory, accounting and auditing sectors. With Silverfin’s ability to integrate with existing software and provide a central data reconciliation platform, Tim, Joris and the team have a huge opportunity to become the gold standard solution for connected accounting”.</p>"
