	</div><p>The apple.com/retail/brickellcitycentre/\">Apple Brickell City Centre store</a> in Miami will share the same aesthetic and features as the company’s other flagship stores, such as the Apple Union Square store in San Francisco.</p><div><div></div></div><p>“This is the first store in downtown Miami. Normally, Miami is all about the beach and the periphery. In the last few years, downtown Miami has seen this kind of renaissance,” Atienza said.</p><p>So there will be a large forum with a video wall. You’ll find the avenues with display windows and regular new designs. And business customers will be able to use the boardroom to talk with Apple employees and get hands-on time with new devices.</p><p>More importantly, the store will have gigantic 13-foot-tall floor-to-ceiling glass windows. This is by far my favorite feature of the Union Square store in San Francisco as it blends the store with the surroundings. I can’t wait to see photos of the store when it opens on March 25.</p><p>A hundred employees will work in this new store. They speak nine different languages and nearly half of the team speaks Spanish.</p><p>Apple’s Nanjing Jinmao Place store and Apple Schildergasse in Cologne will open on March 25. The building in Cologne is beautiful and it is currently covered in iMessage confetti effect posters:</p><p><img src=\"<<[site-url]>>/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Apple-is-opening-new-stores-in-Downtown-Miami-Cologne-and-Nanjing-1.jpg\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1521\" srcset=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/k4i1120_1_1-jpg.jpeg?w=1024&amp;h=1521 1024w, https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/k4i1120_1_1-jpg.jpeg?w=2048&amp;h=3042 2048w, https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/k4i1120_1_1-jpg.jpeg?w=101&amp;h=150 101w, https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/k4i1120_1_1-jpg.jpeg?w=202&amp;h=300 202w, https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/k4i1120_1_1-jpg.jpeg?w=768&amp;h=1141 768w, https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/k4i1120_1_1-jpg.jpeg?w=458&amp;h=680 458w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" alt=\"Apple is opening new stores in Downtown Miami, Cologne and Nanjing\"></p><small>Featured Image: JEWEL SAMAD/AFP/Getty Images</small>"
