  <p>Microsoft will distribute the final version of the Windows 10 Creators Update to testers by the end of the month, sources familiar with the company’s plans tell <em>The Verge</em>. The software giant is currently in the final phases of <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/tag/development/\" title=\"Development\">Development</a>, but has not publicly revealed a date for when the Creators Update will be made available broadly. Internally, the company is targeting early April for fully compatible devices, with a staggered rollout throughout April.</p>
<p><em>Windows Central</em> reported earlier this week that Microsoft is planning to distribute release candidates of the final version of the Windows 10 Creators Update to testers next week, with a public release on April 11th. Once a final version is selected, testers will have access to it by the end of March. Microsoft will also prepare a number of patches for the Windows 10 Creators Update, to address minor issues that aren’t fixed in the bigger release. Microsoft has previously promised to be more transparent about these updates to ensure users aren’t rebooting many times after the Creators Update begins rolling out.</p>
<p>Microsoft is adding a number of new features to Windows 10 Creators Update, including a new Game Mode, 3D Paint, mixed reality headsets support, a picture-in-picture mode, and improvements to Microsoft Edge’s tab mode. Microsoft originally promised an overhaul of the taskbar with a People bar, but the company has delayed this feature to a second update planned later this year.</p>      <div>
