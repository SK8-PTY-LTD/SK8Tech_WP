        </figure><p>Mr Taylor was frustrated that the Pentagon could only communicate with three research institutions, whose timeshared computers it helped fund, by using three incompatible systems.</p><p>So, he proposed a scheme to connect all of Arpa's sponsored bases together via a single network.</p><p>\"I just decided that we were going to build a network that would connect these interactive communities into a larger community in such a way that a user of one community could connect to a distant community as though that user were on his local system,\" he later recalled in an interview with the Charles Babbage Institute.</p><p>\"Most of the people I talked to were not initially enamoured with the idea. I think some of the people saw it initially as an opportunity for someone else to come in and use their [computing cycles].\"</p><p>Nevertheless, he was given $1m (Â£796,000) to pursue the project.</p><p>And in 1968, a year before Arpanet was established, he co-authored a prescient paper with a colleague.</p><p>\"In a few years, men will be able to communicate more effectively through a machine than face to face,\" <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/licklider.pdf\">it predicted</a>.</p><p>\"The programmed digital computer... can change the nature and value of communication even more profoundly than did the printing press and the picture tube, for, as we shall show, a well-programmed computer can provide direct access both to informational resources and to the processes for making use of the resources.\"</p><h2>Sugar supplies</h2><p>Mr Taylor's time at Arpa was also spent trying to see whether his country could make use of computer technology to solve logistics problems during the Vietnam war.</p><p>The White House had complained that it was getting conflicting reports about the number of enemies killed, bullets available and other details.</p><p>\"The Army had one reporting system; the Navy had another; the Marine Corp had another,\" Mr Taylor later recalled.</p><p>\"It was clear that not all of these reports could be true. </p><p>\"I think one specific example was that if the amount of sugar reported captured were true we would have cornered two-thirds of the world's sugar supply, or something like that. It was ridiculous.\"</p><p>His efforts led to a uniform method of data collection and the use of a computer centre at an air force base to collate it.</p><p>\"After that the White House got a single report rather than several,\" Mr Taylor said.</p><p>\"That pleased them; whether the data was any more correct or not, I don't know, but at least it was more consistent.\"</p><h2>Apple and Microsoft</h2><p>Once Arpanet was up and running in 1969, Mr Taylor left the Pentagon and the following year he founded the Computer Science Laboratory of the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (Xerox Parc).</p><figure>
