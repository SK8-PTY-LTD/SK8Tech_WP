  <p>The European Commission (the executive arm of the EU) has launched a new initiative to encourage whistleblowers to step forward. A whistleblowing hotline including an email address, phone number, and encrypted web form will allow individuals to anonymously report price-fixing cartels and other anti-competitive practices. </p>
<p>In a press statement, Margrethe Vestager, head of competition policy, said: \"If people are concerned by business practices that they think are wrong, they can help put things right. Inside knowledge can be a powerful tool to help the Commission uncover cartels and other anti-competitive practices. With our new tool it is possible to provide information, while maintaining anonymity.”</p>
<p>The Commission said it previously relied on its leniency program for such tips, which allows businesses to report cartels they were involved in for a reduced fine. So far in 2017, the Commission has already fined firms involved in two cartels more than €200 million for working together to raise prices on items including air conditioning systems for cars. </p>
<p>The new whistleblowing tools are also intended to attract information on anti-trust cases. The Commission is currently pursuing a number of these, including several targeting Google for its allegedly anti-competitive business practices involving Android, online shopping, and its lucrative ad business. </p>      <div>
