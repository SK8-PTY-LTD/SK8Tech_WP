Tap on those avatars and you can instantly begin chatting with them. </p><p>A Snap spokeswoman confirmed the new feature. </p><p>The release comes as Facebook, Snapchat's biggest rival, continues its barrage of cloning Stories, one of Snapchat's marquee features. It lets users post a string of videos and photos that disappear after 24 hours. Facebook has added a similar feature to its Instagram, WhatsApp and app-talks-discounts-and-deals/\" target=\"_blank\" data-component=\"externalLink\">Messenger</a> apps, and is <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/tag/testing/\" title=\"Testing\">Testing</a> it on Facebook's main <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/tag/app/\" title=\"App\">App</a> in Ireland. So while Facebook focuses on Stories, it looks like Snap is looking to build out other features.</p>
