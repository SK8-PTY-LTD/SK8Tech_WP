The latter are described as people with successful five-plus year careers who are working on an idea for a startup but, due to a lack of financial support or a suitable co-founder, have yet to quit their day job and make the switch to startup life.</p><p>“We noticed that there are a lot of people who are on successful career paths but are looking to start or join startups – these are the people we call ‘pre-founders’,” explains Icebreaker co-founder and Partner Riku Seppälä. “There is no support for them here [in Finland], they don’t know… investors and have trouble connecting with co-founders”.</p><p>The solution, reckons Seppälä, is a new fund in Finland that not only plans to invest at the angel and seed stage — writing cheques of between €40,000 and €350,000 — but also one that acts as a catalyst for the country’s early-stage startup scene as a whole. This includes running various community building activities designed to help “pre-founders” find one another and ensure different skill-sets and experiences collide.</p><p>“The majority of our community’s pre-founders are working long hours at their current jobs,” says Aleksi Partanen, also a co-founder and Partner at Icebreaker. “Once they have the idea and at least part of the team in place our investment enables them to start developing their startup full-time while they are able to pay their bills as well. The support does not end after the investment but the teams can accelerate their development through our community”.</p><p>The Icebreaker community, which exists online and offline via multiple kinds of events being run and supported by the newly-outed VC, is designed not only to help co-founders find each other — in a vein not entirely dissimilar to some of the work being carried out by the U.K.’s Entrepreneur First — but also new recruits, advisors, contacts, customers, and wider feedback.</p><div><div></div></div><p>“One of the biggest challenges with pre-founders is that they usually don’t have a network of complementary co-founders,” says Icebreaker’s third co-founder and Partner Lasse Lehtinen. “We tackle this issue by  facilitating pre-founders connecting with complementary co-founders. We also provide them with advice and mentoring from experienced founders, advisors and investors that they would have difficulty getting in contact with otherwise”.</p><p>The next Icebreaker event, dubbed “Pre-Founder Project,” will see the Finnish VC firm invite 50 “qualified pre-founders” for afterwork events and workshops with different themes.</p><p>“The goal is they find co-founders, get access to mentoring, hear about how different startups got started and challenge and support each other to move forward with their own ideas,” says Lehtinen.</p><p>“We also put our experience and contacts in play to get them on a solid path towards their Series A. The support together with our investment increases their chances of success and in turn we get great results,” adds Partanen.</p>"
