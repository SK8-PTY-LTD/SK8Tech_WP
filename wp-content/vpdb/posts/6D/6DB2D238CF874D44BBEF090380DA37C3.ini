Using a fingerprint gets rid of that.\"</p><p>\"Fingerprints have helped us avoid using terrible passwords, and even the most gullible person is not going to cut off their finger if [a criminal] asks nicely.\"</p><h2>No scanner needed</h2><p>The cards are thought to be the first to include both the digital template of the user's fingerprint and the sensor required to read their fingerprints at the point of sale.</p><p>Previous biometric payment cards only worked when used in conjunction with a separate fingerprint scanner.</p><p>That limited their usefulness, as only stores with the correct equipment could accept them.</p><p>Having both the data and the scanner on the same card means that they should be accepted everywhere a normal chip and PIN payment card can be used.</p><p>But the biometric verification can only be used for in-store purchases: online and other so-called \"card not present\" transactions will still require further security measures.</p>
