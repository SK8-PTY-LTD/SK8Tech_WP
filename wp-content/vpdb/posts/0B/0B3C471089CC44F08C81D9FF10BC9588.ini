                    The Galaxy Tab S3 was the first of two tablets unveiled by Samsung at a tech trade show in Barcelona

        </figure><p>Samsung has, for the first time since 2013, opted not to unveil a flagship Galaxy S smartphone at the Mobile World Congress tech show.</p><p>Instead, it showed off two new tablet computers and a virtual reality headset that comes with a remote control.</p><p>However, a new smartphone was briefly teased at the end of the company's presentation at the Barcelona event.</p><p>Samsung said the new device would be unveiled on 29 March in New York.</p><p>\"Not having [the successor to the S7] there will be a particular boon to Huawei,\" noted tech analyst Tim Coulling at Canalys, referring to Samsung's Chinese rival.</p><div aria-hidden=\"true\">

</div><p>\"But it's known something is coming out, so the Samsung fans will probably be willing to wait.\"</p><p>The hiatus follows trouble for the South Korean tech giant after its Galaxy Note 7 phone had to recalled twice, the second time permanently.</p><p>Faulty batteries in the devices led some to catch fire.</p><h2>Greenpeace protest</h2><p>Campaign group Greenpeace made an unexpected appearance at the presentation. A protestor took to the stage with a banner saying \"reduce, reuse, recycle\" - apparently referring to the millions of Note 7 handsets that had to be withdrawn.</p><p>More protestors rolled out another banner on the side of the building where the press conference was taking place.</p><figure>

                    The Galaxy Book tablet is aimed at professionals

        </figure><p>Of the new tablets, the Galaxy Tab S3 is the smaller of the two and comes with a 9.7in (24.6cm) screen. It is targeted at consumers who want to prioritise gaming and video playback.</p><p>The larger Galaxy Book comes in two sizes: 10.6in and 12in. Samsung said it was suited to \"on-the-go professionals\". It comes with a snap-on keyboard and S-Pen stylus.</p><p>The S3 runs Android 7.0 Nougat while the Book's operating system is Windows 10. </p><p>\"Like most of its competitors, Samsung has seen its tablet sales erode in recent years, as larger smartphones have pushed into tablet territory,\" noted Rhoda Alexander at analysts IHS Technology.</p><p>But she added that the organic light-emitting diode (OLED) displays and powerful specifications of the new tablets should help differentiate the products from competitors.</p><figure>

                    Samsung also launched a new Gear VR headset and remote control
                </span>
            </figcaption>
            
        </figure><h2>Virtual gear</h2><p>Samsung also launched a Gear VR headset and remote control.</p><p>As with previous generations, the headset is a tie-up with Facebook's Oculus division.</p><p>The remote is designed for one-handed control. It features a touchpad that lets users select options within virtual reality apps, and motion sensors to detect hand movements.</p><p>In the past, owners had to use controls built into the headset or buy a third-party gamepad. That compared unfavourably with Google's rival Daydream View headset, which featured a motion-sensing controller of its own.</p><p>The new Gear VR is compatible with the recent Galaxy S and Note handsets.</p>
