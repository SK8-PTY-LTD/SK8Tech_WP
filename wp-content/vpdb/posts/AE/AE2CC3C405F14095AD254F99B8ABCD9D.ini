PayPal said Venmo doubled its total transactions to $17.6 billion during the same time. And, a whopping 81 percent of Venmo's users are millennials -- 10 percentage points higher than millennial darling Snapchat, ComScore reported last year.</p><p> 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	A mix of its young users  	 	 	 	 	shunning credit cards, oversharing social culture and fewer moms and dads infiltrating the service have bolstered Venmo, which Braintree acquired in 2012 for $26.2 million. (PayPal bought Braintree a year later.)</p><p> 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	The social feeds sparked new behaviors among users and revealed just how interactive payments can become. A typical usage involves one person paying for a large dinner party with her credit card, then Venmo'ing requests to everyone else for their shares.

     </aside><h3><strong>Origins of Venmo</strong></h3><p>     	 	 	 	 	 	 	Venmo becoming a social network comes as a surprise to Iqram Magdon-Ismail, the service's boisterous, curly-haired 33-year-old co-founder. (He left Venmo in 2014 and is now working on an audio platform called Ense.)</p><p>     	 	 	 	 	 	 	He and Andrew Kortina, who  	 	 	 	 met as freshman-year roommates at the University of Pennsylvania, came up with the idea after Magdon-Ismail forgot his wallet when visiting Kortina in New York in 2009 and had to rely on his friend to pay for everything upfront. It spurred him to ask: Why can't I just text Andrew back the <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/tag/money/\" title=\"Money\">Money</a>?</p><p>     	 	 	 	 	 	 	The first version of Venmo (it stands for \"Vendor Mobile,\" Magdon-Ismail said) was private, text-based and only for BlackBerry phones. But, as more of their friends tested it out, Magdon-Ismail would wake up every morning and see all the latest payments.</p><p>     	 	 	 	 	 	 	\"For me, it was like reading the newspaper,\" Magdon-Ismail said. \"I was thinking in the back of my head, 'What if we made a feed for everybody. This kind of is like Facebook or Twitter for me.' \"</p><p>     	 	 	 	 	 	 	The decision to expose the payments publicly was controversial. Some at the company worried about privacy issues, others argued that the feed would be boring. Magdon-Ismail pushed for the change, and it helped the <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/tag/app/\" title=\"App\">App</a> go viral.</p><p>     	 	 	 	 	 	 	New users seeing their friends paying with the <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/services/startup-consulting/\" title=\"StartUp\" target=\"_blank\">StartUp</a> service created a layer of trust, known as \"social proof,\" Lampe said, and encouraged them to bring more friends along.</p><p>     	 	 	 	 	 	 	But, in addition to that trust, there are still clearly wrong ways to Venmo. After all, it exists in the highly regulated banking industry.</p><figure section=\"shortcodeImage\"><span><span><img src=\"<<[site-url]>>/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/20170313_58c6b28d09dd0.jpg\" alt=\"Venmo: The secret, hip social network you've never heard of        The PayPal-owned <a href=\">app</a> has unexpectedly created a social culture, and many of the thorny problems that come with one.\" height=\"0\" width=\"570\" data-original=\"        https://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/img/FmDetlcVfWHmewDQdoDADgbtXpQ=/0x40:750x306/fit-in/570x0/2017/03/10/a1fb6a26-45dc-4913-8305-8622705da20d/image4.jpg\"></span><noscript><span itemprop=\"image\" itemscope itemtype=\"https://schema.org/ImageObject\"><img src=\"<<[site-url]>>/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/image4.jpg\" height=\"0\" width=\"570\" alt=\"Venmo: The secret, hip social network you've never heard of        The PayPal-owned <a href=\">app</a> has unexpectedly created a social culture, and many of the thorny problems that come with one.\"><meta itemprop=\"url\" content=\"https://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/img/FmDetlcVfWHmewDQdoDADgbtXpQ=/0x40:750x306/fit-in/570x0/2017/03/10/a1fb6a26-45dc-4913-8305-8622705da20d/image4.jpg\"><meta itemprop=\"height\" content=\"0\"><meta itemprop=\"width\" content=\"570\"></span></noscript></span></figure><p>     	 	 	 	 	 	 	Ross Lipschultz, 26, from Chicago, said his account was suspended for days after he paid a friend back for drinks and wrote the message, as some forgotten joke: \"A cool night in Havana.\" Venmo emailed him that the reference to Cuba's capital was flagged for potentially violating US sanctions under the federal Office of Foreign Assets Control.</p><p>    It can be so easy to send and receive <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/tag/money/\" title=\"Money\">Money</a> that Sarah Vakili accidentally messed up the process.
