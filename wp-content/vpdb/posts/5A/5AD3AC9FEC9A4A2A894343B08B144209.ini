        </figure><p>Aimed specifically at the older generation, Breezie offers a simplified interface for a standard Samsung Galaxy tablet.</p><p>It can be customised to make sure it has the settings and apps the customer wants, rather than a bunch of preset ones they will never use. </p><p>And the ones they do have are made easy to use - so, for example, someone wanting to use Skype simply has to tap on a friend's picture in the address book.</p><p>Company founder Jeh Kazimi told BBC News Breezie had been inspired by his own mother.</p><p>\"I watched her trying to navigate the internet and saw that she found it intimidating and complicated,\" he says.  </p><p>\"I couldn't find anything on the market that could make the internet work for her, so I created it myself.\"  </p><p>\"Our goal was to <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/tag/design/\" title=\"Design\">Design</a> software that makes the online environment considerably more accessible for people with little or no technological nous and to do so without patronising or limiting them.\"</p><p>Users can give a trusted relative or friend the ability to sign-in remotely, set-up accounts and add contacts, via Breezie's support service. </p><p>Last year it teamed up with Age UK to launch the tablet, which costs Â£299 with the Breezie platform pre-installed.</p><h2>Touching problem</h2><figure>
