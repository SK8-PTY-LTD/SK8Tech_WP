The batteries in your headphones could be the biggest safety risk next time you fly. </p><p>The Australian Transport Safety Bureau  issued a safety warning this week after a woman was badly burned by a pair of battery-powered headphones that exploded while she was sleeping. </p><p>After hearing a \"loud explosion\" two hours into a flight from Beijing to Melbourne, the ATSB said, the woman received burns across her face, neck, lips and hand when the headphones caught fire. </p><p>\"As I went to turn around I felt burning on my face,\" she told the ATSB. \"I just grabbed my face which caused the headphones to go around my neck.</p><p>\"I continued to feel burning so I grabbed them off and threw them on the floor. They were sparking and had small amounts of fire.\"</p>
