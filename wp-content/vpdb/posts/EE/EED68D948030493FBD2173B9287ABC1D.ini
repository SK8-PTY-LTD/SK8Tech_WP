In addition to the table, each company selected will get three minutes on the Showcase Stage in the heart of Startup Alley to demo their product to the thousands of Disrupt attendees.</p><p>And if you aren’t selected, don’t fret! There will be a chance to buy discounted tickets to your relevant Featured Pavilion so your startup can get in on the action as well.</p><p>The application deadline for these featured pavilions is March 14, 2017, and we’ll be notifying the winners shortly thereafter.</p><div><div></div></div><p>You can fill out an application here.</p><p>If you aren’t in one of the categories we’re looking for, your startup can still participate in the Startup Alley or Hardware Alley at Disrupt, and we’ve got a special deal for you. Startups who purchase Startup Alley ticket packages before March 3, 2017 will get three tickets for the price of two.</p><p>You can find out more information and purchase your Startup Alley tickets here.</p><p>Disrupt NY 2017 takes place May 15-17 at New York’s Pier 36.
