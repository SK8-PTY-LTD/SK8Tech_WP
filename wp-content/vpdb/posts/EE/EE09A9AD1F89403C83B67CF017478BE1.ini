The vendor didn't correctly communicate the numbers to me, but, even worse, I didn't verify them myself before posting. The only excuse I have to offer is that I was on the road and in a bit of a rush. I totally get that it's frustrating to see a price that's higher than what I've said it will be, and I'm genuinely sorry for the mistake.</p><p>I've said it before, I'll say it again: Different headphones for different occasions.</p><p>And if you're one of those active types, you need something that can withstand the rigors of exercise: the bouncing, the sweating and so on.</p><p>You can easily spend upwards of $100 on such a product, but you don't have to: For a limited time, and while supplies last, Jelly Comb (via Amazon) is offering its Bluetooth sport earphones for $9. That's after applying promo code <strong>XIDHO97Y</strong> at checkout.</p>

        </div>                        <p>As of 7:45 a.m. ET, that code is tested and verified, and the product is in stock from seller Jelly Comb Direct. No idea how much inventory is available at this price.</p><p>Yes, I've shared about a zillion similar sport 'phones. Three things I like about these:</p><p>1. The accompanying ear loops will absolutely positively keep the earbuds in place. Other 'buds can bounce loose when you're running, aerobicizing, etc.</p><p>2. The play/pause/answer button is raised and easy to find by touch, and the volume control is, similarly, a raised rocker. <em>So</em> many of the similar products I've seen use flush-mounted buttons that are really difficult to control by feel.</p><p>3. $9!</p><p>I also like that these are corded, so if you need to pop them off your ears, they can dangle around your neck. There's a built-in microphone as well, meaning you can make/take calls, though if you check the reviews, you'll see the microphone quality is perhaps a little sub-par.</p><p>Speaking of which, the reviews are mostly positive. It's probably unwise to expect miraculous quality and performance from $9 sport 'phones, but as long as they work, they're probably a great addition to your gym bag.</p><p>Your thoughts?</p><figure section=\"shortcodeImage\"><div data-open=\"modal\" data-target=\"#f41b88d0-3fdd-4df2-8772-2eb5377d9adc\" data-component=\"modalEnlargeImage\"><span><img src=\"<<[site-url]>>/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/20170427_590219d954641.jpg\" alt=\"Get a set of sport Bluetooth earphones for $9        Yes, another one, but these have the all-important earloop to keep them in place during vigorous exercise.

It struck a chord with readers -- and sold out very quickly. Good news: It's back! You can get the Ugreen Elastic Organizer Board for $8.79 when you apply promo code <strong>5ANL9A5F</strong> at checkout. That's for the large version; the medium board will run you $8.49 after promo code <strong>UR83XNT6</strong>. Those are hardly massive savings, but I did promise you I'd let you know when these were back in stock.</p><p>Interesting side note: This is one instance where a poor Fakespot grade (it got an 'F') is likely not indicative of the quality of the product. Because unless it's literally falling apart at the seams, it almost certainly works as advertised. (I just ordered one; will let you know next time.) So don't let the bad Fakespot grade deter you. As I've said before, <em>all </em>reviews -- including reviews of reviews -- need to be taken with a grain of salt.</p><p><strong>Bonus deal No. 2:</strong> Ack! Thpppt! If those two \"words\" mean anything to you, you know I'm talking about Berkeley Breathed's beloved Bloom County comic (which was revived in 2015 and currently appears on Facebook!). Whether you're an old fan or you've never had the pleasure, here's a deal not to be missed: Humble Bundle is offering a giant Bloom County digital-comics bundle for $15, with a portion of proceeds going to charity.</p>
