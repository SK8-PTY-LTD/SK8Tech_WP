  <p>Sex toys may have gotten smarter with the integration of apps and big data over the past few years, but for the most part they’re still heavily manual. And probably for a good reason! Different people prefer different kinds of pressure levels and movements! But if the act of using a sex toy has become too much work for you, Fleshlight wants to fix that. </p>
<p>Introduced at the Adult Entertainment Expo in Las Vegas in January and on display again at SXSW, the Fleshlight Launch is an automated stroker designed for you to mount a Fleshlight on. There are touch-capacitive controls on the side that let you choose the speed, which can perform up to 180 strokes per minute. You can also sync the Fleshlight Launch to your computer or mobile device via Bluetooth and select from a catalog of adult content to synchronize the action.</p>

<p>All of this seems <em>fine </em>(I guess? I don’t have a penis), but it’s probably good to note that this thing is massive. The Launch measures roughly 12.5 x 6 x 6.5 inches — which is not very discreet — and Fleshlight did not specify its weight. Essentially, it looks like mounting a spaceship on your pelvis. Charge time is estimated at six to nine hours for one hour of use. </p>
<p>For those bold and confident enough to stick their junk in this contraption, Fleshlight Launch costs $199 and is available now. The early general feedback for this device appears to be pretty conflicted, but hey, there certainly must be a market out there.</p>      <div>
