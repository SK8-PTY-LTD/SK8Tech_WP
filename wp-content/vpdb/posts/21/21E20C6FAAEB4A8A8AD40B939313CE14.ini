</div><p>However, according to a tweet posted on Thursday by the <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/services/aso/\" title=\"App Store\" target=\"_blank\">App Store</a> Games Twitter account, the indie games hub will be a permanent installation on the <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/services/aso/\" title=\"App Store\" target=\"_blank\">App Store</a>, after the promotional period wraps. In March, Apple suggested its refreshing the content in the indie hub daily, but presumably that pace will slow when the “Celebrating Indie Games” push ends.</p><div><div></div></div><p>For indie developers – that is, those who are small, self-published, and self-funded, according to Apple’s definition – the change could greatly impact their discoverability on the <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/services/aso/\" title=\"App Store\" target=\"_blank\">App Store</a>. A dedicated section for finding these titles offers developers a way to get in front of potential new users, without having to pay for <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/services/aso/\" title=\"App Store\" target=\"_blank\">App Store</a> Search ads, or other ads on sites like Facebook.</p><p>Games remain one of the most popular categories of apps and account for the majority of App Store revenue. According to data from Sensor Tower, more than 80 percent of all money earned through Apple’s App Store came from mobile games in 2016. appannie.com/insights/market-data/gaming-apps-maintain-revenue-stronghold/\">App Annie’s figures</a> were slightly lower, at 75 percent of all <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/services/aso/\" title=\"App Store\" target=\"_blank\">App Store</a> revenue.</p><p>Last year, mobile gaming also was poised to take a larger share than PC gaming with $36.9 billion in revenues, up 21.3 percent worldwide, Newzoo’s report said.</p><p>The promotional efforts seem to be working. Currently, titles like Botnicula, Surgeon Simulator and Prune – all of which are being featured in the new hub – are sitting high on the <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/services/aso/\" title=\"App Store\" target=\"_blank\">App Store</a>’s Top Paid Apps chart at #7, #1, and #5, respectively.</p>"
