The business will be able to join the stock market as soon as April.</p><p>The offering is said to raise $100 million, but that number is subject to change. We will get more of an indication in the coming weeks about how Yext plans to price its shares.</p><p>With clients like Best Buy, McDonald’s and Marriott, Yext is responsible for the location results that appear on search engines, <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/services/content-marketing/\" title=\"Social Media\" target=\"_blank\">Social Media</a> and maps. The company had the early vision that consumers would prefer to find nearby locations without visiting brand websites.</p><p>The company brought in $88.6 million in revenue in the nine months ending in October of last year, with losses of $28.6 million for the same time frame. Revenue is up from $64 million in the same period the year before and losses narrowed to $18.2 million.</p><p>“We have a history of losses and may not achieve profitability in the future,” the company warned in its risk factors section of the filing. They also cautioned about their dependencies on third-party resellers, which accounts for a “significant portion” of revenue.</p><div><div></div></div><p>With an army of Salesforce alums, some Yext employees look up to charismatic leader Howard Lerman and often compare him to Marc Benioff. </p><p>Founded in 2006, Yext has been rumored to go public for several years now. The company raised more than $117 million in <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/tag/venture/\" title=\"Venture\">Venture</a> funding at more than a $500 million valuation.</p><p>Sutter Hill Ventures owns 23.6 percent of Yext leading into the IPO. Institutional <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/tag/venture/\" title=\"Venture\">Venture</a> Partners, Marker Financial Advisors and Insight Venture Partners also have large stakes.</p><p>The filing puts Yext on a short-list of New York tech companies that have made the journey from <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/services/startup-consulting/\" title=\"StartUp\" target=\"_blank\">StartUp</a> to the stock market. Etsy and OnDeck are also on that list.</p>"
