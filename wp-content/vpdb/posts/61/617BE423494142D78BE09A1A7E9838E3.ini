Now it's available stateside, but remains in beta \"which means it isn't perfect just yet,\" Pinterest warned in a blog Thursday. </p><p>\"It is pretty good with recipe ingredients and outfit ideas. And if you Lens a throw pillow, chair or piece of art over at your friend's house, you should turn up some great ideas,\" the company wrote. \"But Lens is still learning, and doesn't always recognize exactly what you're looking for.\"</p><p>That's the idea behind this and other machine learning tools that get smarter over time. Other reverse image search tools, according to VentureBeat, include Shutterstock, Snaplay, ImageBrief, and TinEye. Google also has a reverse image search tool.</p>
