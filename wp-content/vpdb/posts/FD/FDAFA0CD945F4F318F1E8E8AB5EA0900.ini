        </div>                        <p>The Justice Department under former President Barack Obama declined to press charges for revealing the sensitive secrets, concluding that WikiLeaks was working in a capacity akin to journalism. But the case was never formally closed, and the Justice Department under President Donald Trump has signaled a willingness to take another look at the case. </p><p>The ACLU said such prosecution would inevitably represent a threat to the press.</p><p>\"Never  in the history of this country has a publisher been prosecuted for  presenting truthful information to the public,\" Ben Wizner, director of the ACLU Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project, said in a statement. \"Any prosecution of  Wikileaks for publishing government secrets would set a dangerous  precedent that the Trump administration would surely use to target other  news organizations.\"</p><p>Prosecuting Assange could prove tricky, though. He's been living in asylum in the Ecuadorian embassy in London since 2012 after Swedish investigators issued a European arrest warrant for Assange that required British police to detain and extradite him. He's trying to avoid extradition to Sweden out of fear he'd then be extradited to the US to face questioning related to the  classified material published on WikiLeaks. </p>
