  <p>Plex launched Plex Cloud — a new feature for the company’s media streaming solution that allowed users to store content in a cloud account instead of a local computer or a NAS system — in beta last September. And now, Plex is finally opening up the feature to all of its Plex Pass subscribers. </p>
<p>It’s not necessarily a cheaper way to get access to all your movies, music, and TV shows on all your devices — you’ll have to pay the $4.99 per month or $39.99 per year fee for a Plex Pass subscription, in addition to supplying the digital space on your cloud provider to actually store your files. Plex Cloud works with Dropbox, Google Drive, and OneDrive. But regardless of which service you use, you’re probably going to have to shell out a bit extra to fit your files.</p>
<p>That said, if you’ve got a ton of local media kicking around and want to build what essentially boils down to your personal Netflix without all the hardware requirements of running your own home server, it might be worth giving Plex Cloud a try. </p>      <div>
