        </figure><p>The puzzles present challenges that people find simple but computers can find more difficult, such as:</p><ul>
<li>identifying photographs of dogs in a gallery of animal pictures</li>
<li>typing numbers from a photograph of a road sign into a box</li>
<li>listening to somebody reading out numbers over music and typing the numbers into a box</li>
</ul><p>The puzzles also benefit companies such as Google by helping train artificial intelligence algorithms. For example, if Google's AI can not recognise a house number in a photograph taken by a Streetview car, it may add the photo to its Captcha system to get human input.</p><p>However, genuine users can find the interruption by puzzles a nuisance.</p><p>Google's reCaptcha system has already simplified the process by asking users to tick a check box on the <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/tag/website/\" title=\"Website\">Website</a> they are using. The box monitors how each person has interacted with it, to separate natural human clicks from bots.</p><p>For example, an automated script might take just a second to fill in a form on a <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/tag/website/\" title=\"Website\">Website</a>, and may not move the mouse at all during the process.</p><p>Google's latest <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/tag/development/\" title=\"Development\">Development</a> removes the check box as well, and instead analyses how people have interacted with other elements on a <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/tag/website/\" title=\"Website\">Website</a> such as the \"submit form\" button.</p><p>However, in some cases \"suspicious\" activity will still trigger a puzzle.</p>
