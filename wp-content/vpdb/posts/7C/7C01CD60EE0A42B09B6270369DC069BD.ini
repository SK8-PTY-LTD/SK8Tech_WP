post_content = "<img src=\"<<[site-url]>>/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/You-can-now-send-and-request-money-in-Gmail-on-Android.png\" alt=\"You can now send and request money in Gmail on Android\" /><p>Google Wallet has been integrated into Gmail on the web since 2013, but today Google is rolling out a new integration on mobile. Starting today, users of the Gmail <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/tag/app/\" title=\"App\">App</a> on Android will be able to send or request <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/tag/money/\" title=\"Money\">Money</a> with anyone, including those who don’t have a Gmail address, with just a tap.</p><p>The user experience has been designed to make exchanging money as easy as attaching a file, Google explains in its app-android/\">announcement</a>. To access the new feature, you tap the attachment icon (the paperclip), then choose either send or request <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/tag/money/\" title=\"Money\">Money</a>, depending on your needs. A pop-up window appears where you can input the amount and add a note, and send.</p><p>The entire process takes place in the Gmail <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/tag/app/\" title=\"App\">App</a> — you don’t have to have Google Wallet installed. In addition, recipients can configure it so the <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/tag/money/\" title=\"Money\">Money</a> they receive through Gmail goes directly into their bank account.  There are no fees involved, notes Google.</p><p><img src=\"<<[site-url]>>/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/You-can-now-send-and-request-money-in-Gmail-on-Android.gif\" width=\"680\" height=\"544\" alt=\"You can now send and request money in Gmail on Android\"></p><p>The goal, seemingly, is to take on quick payment apps like PayPal, Venmo or Square Cash, by offering a feature to move <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/tag/money/\" title=\"Money\">Money</a> right within Gmail’s <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/tag/app/\" title=\"App\">App</a>. This could be useful for those times where the <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/tag/money/\" title=\"Money\">Money</a> is already a topic of an email conversation — like when you’re planning a trip with friends, or getting the family to go in together on a gift for your parents, for example.</p><p>But whether or not people would think to turn to Gmail for other uses, like splitting the dinner bill or paying friends back for drinks, is another matter.</p><p>These one-off use cases are still more easily managed in standalone payment apps, where you don’t have to face the clutter of a crowded inbox just to send a friend the few dollars you owe.</p><div><div></div></div><p><img src=\"<<[site-url]>>/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/You-can-now-send-and-request-money-in-Gmail-on-Android-1.gif\" width=\"680\" height=\"648\" alt=\"You can now send and request money in Gmail on Android\"></p><p>That said, Google is hardly alone in trying to expand the functionality of a communications app to include money exchanges. Snapchat offers the ability for friends to pay others via Snapcash, Facebook has a similar feature through Messenger and, outside the U.S., messaging app WeChat is app-wechat-is-becoming-a-mobile-payment-giant-in-china/\">becoming a mobile payment giant</a>, to name a few examples. Messaging platforms, in some cases, also support third-party payment bots, like Messenger’s support for PayPal, Stripe, TransferWise and others.</p><p>Gmail isn’t really a messaging <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/tag/app/\" title=\"App\">App</a>, per se, but its email <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/tag/app/\" title=\"App\">App</a> is one of the most popular on the market, given that Gmail’s user base now eclipses that of Yahoo, Microsoft, AOL and others.</p><p>What is interesting is that it took this long to bring the functionality introduced in 2013 to mobile devices — and it’s only on Android, at launch. That indicates that Gmail’s <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/tag/money/\" title=\"Money\">Money</a> transfer feature was not likely heavily adopted, or there would have been more user demand for a mobile experience by now.</p><p>Google says the <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/tag/money/\" title=\"Money\">Money</a> exchange feature is live now in the U.S. on web and Android.</p>"
