But in the real world, Stewart has turned to medical marijuana.</p><p>To ease his arthritis pain, Stewart, 76, uses marijuana spray, ointment and edible cannabis products. He spoke of his use in a statement released Thursday to support Oxford University's Cannabis Research Plan, a combined effort between the university and <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/tag/venture/\" title=\"Venture\">Venture</a> capital company Kingsley Capital Partners. The project will invest $12.3 million (Â£10 million, AU$16 million) into a center to research cannabis uses and treatments.</p><p>Stewart said in a statement given to The Daily Telegraph that a Los Angeles doctor gave him a medical marijuana prescription two years ago to help with the ortho-arthritis in his hands.</p><p>Using a marijuana-derived spray brought back mobility to his hands, and he was able to make fists again, Stewart said. He also said he regularly used a marijuana-derived ointment and an edible bar to help him sleep.</p><p>\"As a result of this experience, I enthusiastically support the Oxford University Cannabis Research Plan,\" Stewart said. \"This is an important step forward for Britain in a field of research that has, for too long, been held back by prejudice, fear and ignorance.\"</p>
