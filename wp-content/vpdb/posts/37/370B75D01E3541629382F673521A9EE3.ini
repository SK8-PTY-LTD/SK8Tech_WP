A little like the <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/tag/law/\" title=\"Law\">Law</a>, really.</p><p>Next to speak to TMZ was Sen. Marco Rubio, who claims to have a few rap credentials.</p><p>\"Snoop shouldn't have done that,\" he said. \"We've had presidents assassinated before in this country, so anything like that is something people should be really careful about.\"</p><p>He added: \"The wrong person sees that, he gets the wrong idea and you can have a real problem.\" It's a little like the wrong person getting hold of a gun, perhaps.</p><p>Rubio's response was trending in the YouTube Top 50 on Tuesday afternoon, which perhaps goes to show the divided feelings the video understandably engenders. </p><p>On YouTube, Snoop's video enjoys significantly more upvotes than downvotes. </p><div section=\"shortcodeRelatedLinks\">

He was asked how he'd feel if the clown was President Barack Obama, instead of President Donald Trump, a very fair question.
