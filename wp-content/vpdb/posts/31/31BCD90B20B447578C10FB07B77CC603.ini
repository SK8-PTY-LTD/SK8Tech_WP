<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">@dr_angus Yeah, probably a year from now. S will still win on acceleration though, due to having more space for a larger battery.</p>

</div><p>What we do know about the Model 3 so far is that it will have a minimum range of somewhere around 215 miles per charge based on EPA ratings, and that it’ll cost $35,000 before tax rebates for the base model. It’ll also come with all the sensor and compute hardware needed to attain full self-driving, and it will have Autopilot on board, though Model 3 owners will have to pay extra to enable certain features.</p><div><div></div></div>"
