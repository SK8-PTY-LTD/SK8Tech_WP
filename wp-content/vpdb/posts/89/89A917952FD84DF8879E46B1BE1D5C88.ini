  <p>Microsoft appears to have quietly released a new piece of migration software that makes it easier to switch from Mac to Surface devices. The Mac to Surface Assistant, as it’s aptly called, is pretty straightforward: you download it from here, and the software walks you through transferring documents, photos, and media files into a zip file on your desktop that you can then transfer to another device. The company didn’t formally announce it, but Microsoft watchers and Windows sites have nonetheless discovered it. </p>
<p>This isn’t super groundbreaking stuff. You could easily do this transfer yourself, and anyone who moves between devices probably keeps most of their content in a cloud provider like Google, iCloud, or OneDrive. (And many people who don’t move devices still probably keep most of their files in the cloud.) Still, migration software that’s easy to use is always welcome, especially for those making the choice to jump ship from macOS and head on over to Windows 10. </p>
