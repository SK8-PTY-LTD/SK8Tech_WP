	<p>Ask a small business owner what the secret is to success, and you might be surprised by their answer. Small businesses owners aren&#39;t relying on cutthroat competition or trade secrets. Instead, they&#39;re depending on other small businesses to openly share what&#39;s working.</p><p>At 21 years old, Jutta Zeisset decided to take over her family&#39;s chicken farm, located in the 2,000-person town of Weisweil, Germany. Over a decade later, the operation has grown from two to 30 employees and includes a <a href=\"http://hofladen-zeisset.de/\" target=\"_blank\">museum, a cafe and a shop</a>.</p><p>Despite the remote location, Jutta has a regular customer base. Reservations for brunch at her cafe are hard to come by. She credits digital channels and tools with much of this. Facebook has allowed her to attract customers and potential employees who would have otherwise been difficult -- and expensive -- to reach.</p><p>Jutta recognized the opportunity she had to inspire and teach other local business owners. She created a Facebook group, which currently boasts 450 members, and started giving seminars across Germany about how to grow rural businesses using digital media.</p><p>Her story highlights the importance that communities hold for many small business owners. These communities are sources of connection, support and advice. And while Jutta&#39;s rural location might be unique, the stories I&#39;ve heard from business owners across the world are similar. Small business owners share a desire to learn from and teach other businesses.</p><p><strong>Related:&nbsp;<a data-ctorig=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/292516\" data-cturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/292516&sa=U&ved=0ahUKEwjjz4OOr_zTAhVmrlQKHcM-Be8QFggIMAE&client=internal-uds-cse&usg=AFQjCNFDrU_mvnACS-QXS7-zc99m4Isbxw\" dir=\"ltr\" href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/292516\" target=\"_self\">A&nbsp;Small-Business&nbsp;Guide to&nbsp;Facebook&nbsp;Advertising (Infographic)</a></strong></p><h2>Businesses learn from each other.</h2><p>The latest results from the <a href=\"https://eu.futureofbusinesssurvey.org/manager/Storyboard/RHViewStoryBoard.aspx?RId=%C2%B3&RLId=%C2%B3&PId=%C2%B1%C2%B7%C2%B9%C2%B9%C2%B8&UId=%C2%B5%C2%B6%C2%B3%C2%BC%C2%BD&RpId=3\" target=\"_blank\">Future of Business survey</a>, an ongoing collaboration between Facebook, the OECD and the World Bank, illustrate exactly what we have heard from small businesses: that they are building communities by teaching and learning from each other. In fact, 42 percent&nbsp;of businesses told us that learning from each other is one of the primary ways they learn how to run their business in a mobilized economy, coming second only to online searches (64 percent).</p><p>In this mobile-centric economy, business owners must learn new ways to reach and acquire customers. For time-strapped small business owners, who often act as the CEO, the customer service team, and everything in between, this isn&#39;t easy. So, we&#39;re excited to see that businesses are turning to each other to learn. We believe that the experience of starting and running a business makes these entrepreneurs uniquely positioned to teach others about what drives success.</p><p><strong>Related:&nbsp;<a data-ctorig=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/253158\" data-cturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/253158&sa=U&ved=0ahUKEwjjz4OOr_zTAhVmrlQKHcM-Be8QFggLMAI&client=internal-uds-cse&usg=AFQjCNE62D5cxXdztMAW3oU3CKYN3SAv2A\" dir=\"ltr\" href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/253158\" target=\"_self\">How Your&nbsp;Small Business&nbsp;Success Is Linked to&nbsp;Facebook&#39;s&nbsp;Success</a></strong></p><h2>Connection matters.</h2><p>At Facebook, we&#39;ve been thinking about connection and community since we started.
