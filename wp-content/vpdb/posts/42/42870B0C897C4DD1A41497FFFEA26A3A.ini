  <p>Oculus today is receiving an update to its Gear VR platform that will allow users to live stream their virtual reality gaming sessions straight onto Facebook. Much like hitting a button on the Facebook <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/tag/app/\" title=\"App\">App</a> on your smartphone to go live, the update will now offer “Livestream to Facebook” as an option on the Universal Menu when you’re in VR.</p>
<p>The update is rolling out today to users outside the United States, though Oculus says support will arrive stateside “soon.” </p>

<p>Oculus says the goal of enabling this feature is to “share the magic” of VR to friends and family, as it can be a difficult thing to understand without seeing it for yourself. And while it’s not necessarily going after niche communities like Twitch and YouTube Gaming, it does offer an alternative theater venue for those who may just want to live stream gameplay to their closest peers. Moms gotta be knowing what this VR business is about too!</p>      <div>
