But that’s exactly what happened at a Game Developers Conference session with the game’s directors a few weeks back, and the full video of the session is now online. If you’re into BotW, it’s a damned good weekend watch.</p><div><div></div></div><p>(Worth noting: I’d avoid watching this one until you’ve gotten through a good chunk of the game, if not the entire main quest. Much of what makes Breath of the Wild spectacular is the endless sense of discovery that comes with testing the limits of this new Hyrule; the constant “Oh man, it’d be so cool if I could….”, only to find that, well, you can. This pulls back the curtain on a bit of that)</p><p><span style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe type=\"text/html\" width=\"640\" height=\"390\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/QyMsF31NdNc?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>"
