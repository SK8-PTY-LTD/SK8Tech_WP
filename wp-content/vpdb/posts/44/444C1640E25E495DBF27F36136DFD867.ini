Now, the update will appear next to profile names anytime you view contacts, such as when creating a new chat or looking at Group info. At the same time, we’re continuing to build on the new Status feature that gives people fun and engaging ways to share photos, videos and GIFs with their friends and family throughout their day.”</p><p>WhatsApp’s new Snapchat-style Status stories haven’t received as much blowback from users as Facebook Messenger Day because WhatsApp sticks the feature in a separate tab instead of at the top of the list of active threads. But replacing a utilitarian communication feature with a whimsical content-based one broke the behavior patterns of too many users, so now WhatsApp is giving them both.</p><div style=\"width: 690px\"><img src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/whats<a href=\">app</a>-status.png?w=680&#038;h=414\" width=\"680\" height=\"414\" srcset=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/whatsapp-status.png?w=680&amp;h=414 680w, https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/whatsapp-status.png?w=1360&amp;h=828 1360w, https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/whatsapp-status.png?w=150&amp;h=91 150w, https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/whatsapp-status.png?w=300&amp;h=183 300w, https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/whatsapp-status.png?w=768&amp;h=468 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" alt=\"WhatsApp brings back text Status it replaced with Stories\"><p>WhatsApp replaced its text Status feature with this Snapchat Stories clone</p></div><p>Both the new WhatsApp Status and Messenger Day provide an obvious opportunity for these chat apps to monetize by injecting ads between friends’ slideshows. They also could limit Snapchat’s growth and prepare the products for a future more focused around visual communication. Yet the launches have led some to believe the features are more designed to fulfill Facebook’s desires than users’. Rapid responses to feedback could keep these utilities from alienating their billion-plus audiences.</p>"
