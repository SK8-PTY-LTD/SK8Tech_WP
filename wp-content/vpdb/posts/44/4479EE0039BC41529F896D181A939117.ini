It has a strong network of users in certain parts of Latin America and North Africa, and in Myanmar and the Philippines in Southeast Asia, but it is far from as universally popular as WhatsApp or Messenger.</p><div><div></div></div><p>It’s been a fairly hectic past few months of news for Viber. It named formerly mobile advertising executive Djamel Agaoua as its CEO last month — founding CEO Talmon Marco left the company some time ago; he currently runs Uber rival Juno — while it has added a range of new features that include an e-commerce button, public accounts, one-touch video calling, and appear-after-theyre-viewed/\">disappearing multimedia</a>.</p><p>With the global messaging space pretty settled as the apps of choice have solidified their positions in most parts of the world, Viber applies to be pushing its security credentials in a bit to differentiate itself from the rest. app-privacy-grows/\">It added end-to-end encryption and hidden chats</a> last year, although researchers raised doubts around some of the company’s claims.</p><small>Featured Image: viber</small>"
