The app-vigilante-banned-from-app-store/\">controversial crime reporting app </a>was kicked out of the App Store in November shortly after its release because Apple believed it encouraged private citizens to engage in, well…<em>vigilantism</em>. Now the app is back, under different branding. The new “Citizen” <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>\">app</a>, operating in New York City, will send you real-time crime reports based on 911 calls, as well as offer a way for users to live stream crimes, and comment on them.</p><p>In its launch blog post, the Vigilante app had cited a former police officer who said that “average and ordinary” citizens should approach the problem of crime “as a group.” Combined with the app’s name “Vigilante,” there seemed to be a very real danger that people would take this as a direction to put themselves in harm’s way, or take on crime directly, <em>sans</em> police.</p><p>The new Citizen <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>\">app</a> dials down the potential for direct involvement from its users. Citizen instead suggests that users live stream crimes and incidents for others to see and comment on. It also pops up a window to offer “stronger guidance” to “never approach a crime scene, interfere with an incident, or get in the way of police,” as the app’s description states.</p><p>But what isn’t immediately clear is that the app’s content comes from a curated selection of 911 calls.</p><p><img src=\"<<[site-url]>>/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Banned-crime-reporting-app-Vigilante-returns-as-Citizen-says-its-8216report-incident8217-feature-will-be-pulled.jpg\" width=\"382\" height=\"680\" srcset=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/img_1886.jpg?w=382&amp;h=680 382w, https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/img_1886.jpg?w=84&amp;h=150 84w, https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/img_1886.jpg?w=169&amp;h=300 169w, https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/img_1886.jpg 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 382px) 100vw, 382px\" alt=\"Banned crime reporting <a href=\">app</a> Vigilante returns as Citizen, says its &amp;#8216;report incident&amp;#8217; feature will be pulled\"></p><p>“There are about 10,000 911 calls per day in NYC.

We need to do a better job of explaining it,” he says. “We’re treading very carefully.

The identity of a crucial witness could be revealed, it noted, quoting Sam Gregory, program director for WITNESS, a nonprofit that trains people on how to ethically use video to expose human rights violations.
