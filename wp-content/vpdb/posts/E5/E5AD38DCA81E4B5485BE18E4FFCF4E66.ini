<p>In 2012, Vergès created Falcon Pro, one of the better Android Twitter apps out there, and ended up joining Twitter’s core <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/services/ui-ux/\" title=\"UI\" target=\"_blank\">UI</a> team, where he reportedly helped improve the company’s official Android <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/tag/app/\" title=\"App\">App</a>. Tweeting his announcement, he said that he was proud of his work on the company’s Android <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/tag/app/\" title=\"App\">App</a>. </p>
<p>Earlier this week, the Amazon-owned company announced a new product, Pulse, “a place where streamers can post and engage with all of their followers and the greater Twitch community right from the Twitch front page.” </p>
<p>The product is similar to Twitter in that users can post text and video updates to a Channel Feed, which will allow them to interact with their followers. The product began its launch earlier this week, with the entire Twitch community gaining access to the feature “within the next few weeks.”</p>      <div>
