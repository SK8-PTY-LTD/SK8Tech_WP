So this change should mean that Netflix viewers will rate more shows more often – resulting in more data for Netflix.</p><div><div></div></div><p>Netflix also announced that some of this data will be used for a new percent-match feature – designed to indicate how good of a match a show or movie is for you. So if Netflix thinks you’ll really like a show you could see a 95% or even 100% match. It’s almost like a Rotten Tomatoes rating customized for your liking.</p><p>The company also shared some interesting stats surrounding ratings –  at one point more than 50% of all members had rated more than 50 different titles on Netflix, including over 10 billion total 5-star ratings.</p><p>The changes will roll out within the next month or so for users globally.</p><small>Featured Image: Bryce Durbin</small>"
