</div><p>Recently, there have been reports that some groups, for example in Iraq, have taken to attaching weapons to small, commercial drones and using them against security forces.</p><p>However, Gen Perkins suggested deploying large surface-to-air missiles as a defence was probably not economically wise.</p><p>\"I'm not sure that's a good economic exchange ratio,\" he told an audience at the Association of the United States Army's Global Force symposium in Alabama.</p><p>\"In fact, if I'm the enemy, I'm thinking, 'Hey, I'm just gonna get on eBay and buy as many of these $300 quadcopters as I can and expend all the Patriot missiles out there'.\"</p><h2>'Enormous overkill'</h2><p>No further details of the encounter - such as where or how recently it took place - were given, but Gen Perkins did describe the party that launched the missile as \"a very close ally\".</p><p>\"It is clearly enormous overkill,\" said Justin Bronk, a researcher at the Royal United <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/tag/services/\" title=\"Services\">Services</a> Institute.</p><p>\"It certainly exposes in very stark terms the challenge which militaries face in attempting to deal with the adaptation of cheap and readily available civilian technology with extremely expensive, high-end hardware designed for state-on-state warfare.\"</p><p>Mr Bronk also told the BBC that Patriot radar systems, while sophisticated, might struggle to target a small quadcopter effectively.</p><p>Patriot missiles were first produced in 1980 and are operated by 12 countries including the US, the Netherlands, Germany, Japan, Israel and Saudi Arabia.</p><p>The missiles themselves travel at five times the speed of sound, whereas a quadcopter drone typically has a top speed of 50mph (80km/h).</p>
