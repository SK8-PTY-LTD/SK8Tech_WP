The focus is on analogies rather than traditional definitions — for example, BitCoin is “like digital gold,” while a zero-day vulnerability is “like medics discovering a new virus.”</p><p>Of course, these analogies risk being too simplistic, but the explanation doesn’t stop there. On Sideways Dictionary, the analogy is the starting to help readers wrap their heads around the concept, and it’s followed by a (slightly) longer explanation.</p><p><img src=\"<<[site-url]>>/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Jigsaw-and-The-Washington-Post-try-to-explain-tech-jargon-with-their-new-Sideways-Dictionary.gif\" width=\"480\" height=\"366\" alt=\"Jigsaw and The Washington Post try to explain tech jargon with their new Sideways Dictionary\"></p><p><div>
