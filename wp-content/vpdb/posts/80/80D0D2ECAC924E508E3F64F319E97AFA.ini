        </div>                        <p>A new survey by NPR and Ipsos offers some interesting thoughts about the American psyche with respect to our relations with the rest of the world.</p><p>The survey focused on foreign policy. However, pressing Apple and other companies to manufacture in the US is a foreign and economic policy position. It's surely not a free trade position.</p><p>What, then, did Americans say about this \"America First\" thing? </p><p>Only 41 percent of respondents overall agreed that \"American foreign policy should focus on enriching America and Americans.\"</p><p>Yes, 57 percent of Republicans thought it should. However, those pesky independents and Democrats brought the number down.</p><p>The survey also asked specifically about the slogan \"America First.\" </p><p>There was considerable division between those who thought it was about taking care of business at home first and \"putting the welfare and focus on our people.\"</p><p>Others, however, thought it \"short-sighted\" or \"xenophobic.\"</p><p>This is the problem executives have with making important decisions in the Trump era. They could decide to throw the government a bone or two. They could even conclude it's best to contribute wholesale to a changing of the world order.</p><p>This survey, however, suggests the public's feelings about \"America First\" simply aren't that strong. </p><p>Indeed, 42 percent of Americans actually believe that American foreign policy should prioritize promoting democracy and human rights in other countries.</p><p>A surprisingly small proportion -- 24 percent -- say that American foreign policy should look out for Americans, even if it harms people in other countries.  This, despite a mere 40 percent believing that we're still the dominant foreign power in the world.</p><div section=\"shortcodeRelatedLinks\">
