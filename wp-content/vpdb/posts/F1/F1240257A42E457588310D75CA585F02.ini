  <p>Twitter is considering offering a paid subscription to power users, including brands and news organizations, <em>The Verge</em> has confirmed. Twitter users today began tweeting screenshots of the survey and a mock-up of what the premium version of Twitter could look like, with new <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/services/seo-sem/\" title=\"Analytics\" target=\"_blank\">Analytics</a>, alerts about breaking news, and information about what an account’s followers are tweeting about. The advanced features would be contained within Tweetdeck, the company’s app for professionals. The core service would remain free.</p>
<p>“We’re conducting this survey to assess the interest in a new, more enhanced version of Tweetdeck,” a spokeswoman told <em>The Verge</em>. “We regularly conduct user research to gather feedback about people’s Twitter experience and to better inform our product investment decisions, and we're exploring several ways to make Tweetdeck even more valuable for professionals.”</p>

<p>A subscription business could offer Twitter a vital new revenue stream at a time when its advertising revenue has been in decline. As other companies work to peel off the remaining parts of the company’s business, Twitter needs to give its core user base reasons to stick around. It’s unclear that advanced <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/services/seo-sem/\" title=\"Analytics\" target=\"_blank\">Analytics</a> would be a major business for the company. But given the attacks that Twitter is facing from all sides, any investment in the core product is good news for users.  </p>
