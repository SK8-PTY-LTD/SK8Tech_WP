  <p>When Instagram launched its live video streaming feature late last year, it was with a noticeable omission: the ability to save broadcasts once they were concluded, which the company has added to the <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>\">app</a> today.</p>
<p>It’s a move that puts Instagram Live on par with both Twitter’s Periscope and parent company Facebook’s Live, both of which have allowed users to save videos. When Instagram Live launched, Instagram’s head of product Kevin Weil defended the omission as intentional in order to help make users more comfortable with live-streaming by removing pressure that the videos would be saved forever. It’s worth noting that the replays still don’t save by default, perhaps to still give users the peace of mind that their videos won’t be permanently online. </p>
<p>The ability to save live Instagram broadcasts is rolling out today in the latest 10.12 version of the app on both the apple.com/us/app/instagram/id389801252?mt=8\">iOS App Store</a> and apps/details?id=com.instagram.android&amp;hl=en\">Google Play Store</a>. </p>      <div>
