    <figcaption><span>Media caption</span>WATCH: The challenge in making Nokia phones bestsellers again</figcaption>
</figure><p>It is phones like the Nokia 6 - apparently already selling well in China - which are key to any hopes of making the Finnish brand a force to be reckoned with again. But of course yet another slab of metal and glass running Android was never going to excite the analysts and journalists tired of overblown launches where the words \"awesome\" and \"revolutionary\" are thrown around like confetti.</p><p>Hence the decision to remind us of Nokia's glorious past, where everyone seemed to have a phone with that familiar ringtone and nobody was asking to borrow a charger to get them through the day. A stroke of marketing genius then - but a risky strategy.</p><p>If the phone-buying public one now sees Nokia as a retro brand rather one which has been reinvigorated for the 4 and 5G future, then HMD may come to regret its 3310 gimmick.</p>
