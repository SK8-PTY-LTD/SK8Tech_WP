Last year, the Russian competition watchdog found Google guilty of forcing smartphone makers to feature the company's own <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/tag/services/\" title=\"Services\">Services</a> more prominently on Android phones. Regulators in Europe have also been cracking down on Google and Facebook when it comes to hate speech and fake news. </p><p>Regarding the price-fixing case, if a retailer sold an iPhone at an \"inappropriate\" price, Apple sent emails to those retailers asking them to change it, according to the statement by FAS, written in Russian but translated via Google Translate. </p>
