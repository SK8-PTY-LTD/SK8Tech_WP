  <p>If you have an Android tablet running Marshmallow or Nougat and have been wondering why the Google Assistant isn't showing up, here's the reason: it's not coming yet.</p>
<p><em>Android Police </em>confirmed with Google that the Assistant is currently rolling out to Android phones only. \"The Assistant will be available on Android Marshmallow and Nougat phones with <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/services/aso/\" title=\"Google Play\" target=\"_blank\">Google Play</a> <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/tag/services/\" title=\"Services\">Services</a>, this does not include tablets,\" the company wrote.</p>
<div><aside><q>It's not clear why Google is making tablet owners wait</q></aside></div>
<p>Why the distinction? It's not at all clear. Google could be planning a different interface for tablets' bigger screens, but it didn't change a thing for the Assistant's predecessor, Now on Tap.</p>
<p>It's also possible that Google is just trying to maintain a slow rollout for the Assistant — it took months for it to expand beyond the Pixel — but the company has more-or-less opened the floodgates by rolling it out to Android phones, which are far more popular than Android tablets. So it's not entirely evident why tablets, running the same OS, would be a different story.</p>      <div>

<p>Google announced at the end of last month that the Google Assistant would begin rolling out to Marshmallow and Nougat phones in a number of English-speaking countries, and the update seemed to hit most phones sometime last week. The Assistant is a Siri-like interface that pulls together a number of features that Android devices have already been able to do, making them a little bit easier for users to access.</p>
<p>Presumably, the Assistant will hit recent Android tablets eventually — there's just no word on when Google plans to make that happen.</p>
