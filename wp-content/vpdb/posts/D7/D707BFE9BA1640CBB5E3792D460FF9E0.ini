</ul><p>Friday's attack has reignited the debate over whether or not governments should disclose vulnerabilities they have discovered or bought on the black market.</p><p>\"It would be deeply troubling if the NSA knew about this vulnerability but failed to disclose it to Microsoft until after it was stolen,\" said Patrick Toomey, a lawyer working for the American Civil Liberties Union.</p><p>\"These attacks underscore the fact that vulnerabilities will be exploited not just by our security agencies, but by hackers and criminals around the world. </p><p>\"Patching security holes immediately, not stockpiling them, is the best way to make everyone's digital life safer.\"</p><p>Edward Snowden, who famously leaked many internal NSA files in June 2013, criticised the NSA on Friday in a series of tweets.</p><p>\"In light of today's attack, Congress needs to be asking [the NSA] if it knows of any other vulnerabilities in software used in our hospitals,\" he wrote.</p><p>\"If [the NSA] had privately disclosed the flaw used to attack hospitals when they found it, not when they lost it, this may not have happened.\"</p><h2>Outdated systems</h2><p>However, others focused the blame at institutions for being too slow in updating their systems, given that this attack happened almost two months after a (free) fix was made available by Microsoft.</p><p>\"Say what you want to say about the NSA or disclosure process,\" said Zeynep Tufeki, a professor at the University of North Carolina.</p><p>\"But this is one in which what's broken is the system by which we fix.\"</p><p>For the UK's National Health Service, the problem is perhaps more acute. </p><p>Security firms have continually raised alarms about the NHS's reliance on Windows XP, an operating system that is no longer supported by Microsoft.</p>
