On the floor? In the trunk? In an NPR tote bag in the backseat? Nope. Ford wants to store a travel pillow in the head rest, of course.</p><p>This new patent filing by Ford illustrates a secret compartment built-into a vehicle&#8217;s head rest. There&#8217;s a little door that when removed reveals a travel pillow &#8212; you know, the kind that wraps around a neck and is just moderately more comfortable than resting your head on a shoe.</p><p>Ford notes in the filing that car headrests are not designed to facility a comfortable snooze. They&#8217;re designed to combat whiplash. Therefore, this patent, if implemented, would provide a solution for passengers to snooze comfortably while utilizing unused space in the vehicle.</p>"
