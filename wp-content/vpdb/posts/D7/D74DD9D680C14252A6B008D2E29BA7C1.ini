        </figure><h2>Smiley faces</h2><p>Some schools have been given prototype Micro Bits.</p><p>Emily Rowland, a teacher at Manchester's Fairfield High School for Girls, said even the least able of her pupils had been able to use them to show smiley-face graphics.</p><p>But she added the delay to the proper rollout was causing concern.</p><p>\"Some teachers get panicked by the idea that they can only use them for six weeks of the summer term and haven't even seen one yet,\" she said.</p><p>\"Quite a lot of schools will struggle to put them in place this summer, and some will have to put it off until the next school year, and then the issue is who do you give the freebies to?\"</p><p>Another computing teacher, Steve Richards, from Eastlea Community School, in London, had a more positive view of events.</p><p>\"I understand the frustration of other teachers, because it is this wonderful thing that is slightly out of reach,\" he said.</p><p>\"But judging by the kind of things we have been able to do with [the prototypes], it will be worth the wait.\"</p><h2>Android app</h2><p>Although the hardware may be delayed, there is already software available to give children a chance to start coding in advance of receiving their micro-computers:</p><ul>
<li>Samsung unveiled the official Android <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>\">app</a> for the Micro Bit at the Bett show</li>
<li>Microsoft launched a web-based tool several months ago</li>
<li>There are also other resources on the BBC <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>\">website</a>
</li>
</ul><p>To help offset any disappointment, the BBC has also promised to release more copies of the device than it had originally planned, meaning some children in other school years should also receive one.</p><figure>

        </figure><p>Ms Griffiths also stressed that just because the Year 7 pupils would receive the Micro Bits later than had originally been hoped, that would not mean their time with the devices needed to be more limited.</p><p>\"This device was never intended for just for one year,\" she said.</p><p>\"Each child will own their own device, so we are hoping they will use them during the summer holidays.</p><p>\"And we will have loads of activities and stimulus for them to use into Year 8, so it won't be just for one term.\"</p>
