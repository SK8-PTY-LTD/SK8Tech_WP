Within four days of being switched on, the radio telescope array detected its first fast radio burst, or FRB.</p><p>These radio signals are an unsolved space mystery. Not only extremely powerful, they last just milliseconds. It is rare that they repeat, which makes them very hard to predict or locate. Until the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) started scouring the skies, only 23 had ever been found and most of those were identified in previously recorded data.</p><p>The radio telescope array discovered not only one FRB, but three, and it only used eight of its 36 dishes.</p><div section=\"shortcodeRelatedLinks\">
