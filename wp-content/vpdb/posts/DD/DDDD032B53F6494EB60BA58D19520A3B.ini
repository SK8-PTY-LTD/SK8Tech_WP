The idea came from a class that Valdes had talked her way into with the famous <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/tag/venture/\" title=\"Venture\">Venture</a> investor Robert Metcalfe, a professor on the faculty of the  UT Austin.</p><p>“I didn’t have a product before I had the class with Bob,” Valdes recalls. “I had the idea with 10,000 followers on Facebook when it started. I did a lot of sketches and mockups on the <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/tag/design/\" title=\"Design\">Design</a>.”</p><p>By the end of the class, when she had met Holzeu, Valdes knew she had a business and convinced Max to return to Mexico City with her to get the idea off the ground.</p><p>The key to Beek’s simple success is its ease of use. A user can download the <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/tag/app/\" title=\"App\">App</a>, sign in through an integration with Facebook, or Twitter, or by generating an email and password.</p><p>Once in the <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/tag/app/\" title=\"App\">App</a>, a user can either browse through book titles or genres that are automatically populated or import a reading list from GoodReads. This user had a hard time getting the integration with GoodReads to work and wound up giving up on the process after waiting about a minute for the integration to occur.</p><div><div></div></div><p>Under the genre heading (with categories like “Teen”, “LGBT”, “Dystopias”, and “Fantasy”) users get pre-populated book suggestions as well as clips from famous BookTubers (YouTube reviewers who film book reviews).</p><p><span style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe type=\"text/html\" width=\"640\" height=\"390\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/guZx4Fi7QU4?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;start=124&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p><p>In Mexico, where BookTubing (creating book reviews on YouTube) is a thing with its own conference, Beek has been racking up the hits.</p><p>Ideally, future integrations would include getting access to booklists in an Amazon, iBooks, or Google’s Play Books accounts.</p><p>Already the company has about 250,000 monthly active users, who have reviewed roughly 200,000 and according to the founders, the company is only just getting started.</p><p>Because Beek has loftier goals than simply being a book review site. Like Amazon founder, Jeff Bezos, Valdes and her partner see books as a gateway to an expanding number of markets.</p><p>Ultimately, the company wants to be the user-generated source for online reviews across Latin America.</p><p>“Amazon is not really popular in Latin America,” says Valdes. “There’s a huge opportunity in becoming the trusted review site for people and then using that platform to sell products.”</p><p>A vision like that could turn this simple book review site, into a next-generation <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/services/e-commerce/\" title=\"E-Commerce\" target=\"_blank\">E-Commerce</a> juggernaut.</p><small>Featured Image: beek</small>"
