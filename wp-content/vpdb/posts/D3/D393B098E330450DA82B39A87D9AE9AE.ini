  <p>Snapchat’s Android <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/tag/app/\" title=\"App\">App</a> typically lags behind iOS in terms of update rollouts, but today it seems the OS’s users might end up getting an exclusive feature. Twitter user @montrellothingpen tweeted screenshots of his beta Snapchat <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/tag/app/\" title=\"App\">App</a>, which now allows him to turn his friends’ Bitmoji into widgets on his home screen to open a chat.</p>

<p>This looks awesome, actually. Sorry, iOS users (myself included). Granted, this update assumes your besties are actually on Bitmoji, but I’m betting that if your friends are on Snapchat, they’re also on Bitmoji. We’ve reached out to Snap for more clarification about whether this feature is just in <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/tag/testing/\" title=\"Testing\">Testing</a> or if other users can expect to see it soon.</p>      <div>
