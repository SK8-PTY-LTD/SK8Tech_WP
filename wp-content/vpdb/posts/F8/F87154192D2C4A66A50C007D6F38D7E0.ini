And vice versa: You can also get Spotify playlists directly on the Waze <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/tag/app/\" title=\"App\">App</a>. </p><p>If your phone senses the car is at a complete stop, you can also toggle between both of the apps with one tap. </p><p>For Waze, which Google bought in 2013 for $1 billion, the news is minor. But it's the latest expansion for the <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/tag/app/\" title=\"App\">App</a>, which is reportedly <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/tag/testing/\" title=\"Testing\">Testing</a> a ride-sharing service in some cities in the United States and Latin America. </p><p>For now the Waze and Spotify integrations are only for phones running Android, Google's mobile software. For iPhone users, \"We'll keep you posted,\" Waze said.</p>
