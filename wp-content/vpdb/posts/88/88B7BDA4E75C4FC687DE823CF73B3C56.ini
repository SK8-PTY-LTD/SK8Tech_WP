For reasons I won't bore you with, I greatly prefer any Roku box or stick to apple-tv-2015/\" data-annotation=\"true\">Apple TV</a> (which has no Amazon), Google Chromecast (no remote) or Amazon Fire TV (awful, awful <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/services/ui-ux/\" title=\"UI\" target=\"_blank\">UI</a>).</p><p>When the Roku 4 hit the scene back in 2015, it was among the then-rare products to offer 4K streaming -- something most users still don't bother with today. And it was crazy-pricey at $129.99, at least compared with its lower-end brethren.</p><p>But if you've always wanted a Roku 4, whether for its speed or 4K support, now you can get one for cheap: Dealfisher (via Amazon) has the certified refurbished Roku 4 for $55.45 shipped.</p><p>Let me note first that the price has been jumping around a bit since I first spotted this yesterday, when it was originally $59.99, then $59 and now a few bucks below that. Woo! However, it could jump up (or down) again -- I think Dealfisher is competing with some other vendors who are also selling the product for around the same price.</p>
                            
                
                                
                                            


<div data-ad=\"inpage-video-top\">
        </div>                        <p>In any case, the Roku 4 is a discontinued model, having been supplanted by the <span data-error=\"was unable to determine path for annotation\" data-annotation-type=\"CNET_FAM_SERIES\">
        Roku Ultra
    </span>. Differences between the two? I honestly couldn't find a rundown anywhere, but there's no question the Roku 4 remains a top streamer in its class.</p><p>I've got one and I like its speedy, efficient <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/services/ui-ux/\" title=\"UI\" target=\"_blank\">UI</a>. But I don't have a 4K-compatible TV, and honestly I rarely bother with the voice-powered search feature -- mostly because I forget it's there. However, Roku's absolute best trick continues to be the headphone jack in the remote. Plug in and you can watch TV at whatever volume you want, without disturbing those around you.</p><p>I will say that the Roku 4 seems to run hotter than other models I've owned, and I do find that it locks up or needs to be rebooted every so often. Your mileage may vary, of course.</p><p> Read CNET's review if you want to learn more about this model. Given that it previously sold for $129.99, and discounts were rare, it's pretty compelling at $55.</p><p>Your thoughts?</p><figure section=\"shortcodeImage\"><div data-open=\"modal\" data-target=\"#f2593d36-f1c3-4399-a32f-8ad071fe4635\" data-component=\"modalEnlargeImage\"><span><img src=\"<<[site-url]>>/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/20170426_5900c7f2d4524.jpg\" alt=\"Get a refurbished Roku 4 for $55.45        Roku's former flagship streamer is now priced only a bit higher than lower-end models.
