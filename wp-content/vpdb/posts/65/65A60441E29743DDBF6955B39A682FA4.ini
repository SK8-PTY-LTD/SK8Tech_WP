Now Google is opening up access in conjunction with the launch of a tool called Family Link for phones powered by Google's Android software. It lets parents set up kids' accounts, monitor what <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>\">app</a>s they're using, track kids' physical location, govern <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/tag/app/\" title=\"App\">App</a> installation and establish \"screen time\" limits.</p><p>  \"The goal in every area of Google is to improve what we do for kids,\" said Pavni Diwanji, a Google engineering vice president. It was her own daughter, now 11 years old, who searched for Thomas the Tank Engine, so she had a personal stake in the project's success.</p><p>  The shift is technologically, legally and socially complicated but inevitable. Already  56 percent of kids in the US aged 8 to 12 have mobile phones, and text messaging was core to kids' communications long before the apples-iphone-turns-10-where-does-it-go-from-here/\">modern smartphone era began a decade ago</a>. Google is ahead of many competitors, but it's still catching up to the reality of growing up in the digital age.</p>

But it helps Google, too. It's an opportunity to bring millions of new users into the fold -- and to hook them when they're young and impressionable. Tech companies like  apple/\" data-annotation=\"true\">Apple</a> and Microsoft have for decades tried to win over schools and students. After all, today's students are tomorrow's customers.</p><p>  These days, many under-13 kids have Google accounts even though it goes against Google's terms of service.
