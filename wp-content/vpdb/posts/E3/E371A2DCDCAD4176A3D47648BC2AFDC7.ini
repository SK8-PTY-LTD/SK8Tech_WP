        </figure><p>Other ideas detailed at the company’s developers conference in San Jose included work to allow people to “hear” through skin. The system, comparable to Braille, uses pressure points on the skin to relay information. </p><p>“One day, not so far away, it may be possible for me to think in Mandarin, and you to feel it instantly in Spanish,” Ms Dugan said. </p><p>With these announcements, Facebook is envisioning technology that is far in advance of anything currently possible. To achieve sophisticated brain control with today's technology requires the implanting of a computer chip into the brain, something Ms Dugan joked \"simply won't scale\".</p><p>There are already external brain-control technologies on the market, but these are simplistic in comparison. Electroencephalogram tech - known as EEG - can monitor electric impulses in the brain, but only for very basic, structured output - such as moving a dot up or down a computer screen.</p><p>\"We'll need new, non-invasive sensors that can measure brain activity hundreds of times per second,\" Facebook said in a statement. </p><p>\"From locations precise to millimetres and without signal distortions. Today there is no non-invasive imaging method that can do this.\"</p><p>_________</p><p><i>Follow Dave Lee </i>on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC</p><p><i>You can reach Dave securely through encrypted messaging app Signal on: +1 (628) 400-7370</i></p>
