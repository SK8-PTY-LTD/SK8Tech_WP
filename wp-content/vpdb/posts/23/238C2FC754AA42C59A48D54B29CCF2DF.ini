<p><a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/services/startup-consulting/\" title=\"StartUp\" target=\"_blank\">StartUp</a>s in Latin America are using creative solutions to address not just local but also global problems. For investors outside the region, the prospect of working with these <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/services/startup-consulting/\" title=\"StartUp\" target=\"_blank\">StartUp</a>s can appear attractive, yet complicated. Investing in early-stage <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/services/startup-consulting/\" title=\"StartUp\" target=\"_blank\">StartUp</a>s in Latin America can present challenges; however, despite the challenges, time and time again I’ve found it can be well worth the effort.</p>
<p>When I first came to Santiago, Chile in 2010 as part of the pilot round of Start-Up Chile, there was hardly any talk of <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/services/startup-consulting/\" title=\"StartUp\" target=\"_blank\">StartUp</a>s. Most people didn’t even know what <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/services/startup-consulting/\" title=\"StartUp\" target=\"_blank\">StartUp</a>s were. <span><span>Within nine months</span></span> of returning to the U.S., the company I co-founded was acquired. So I decided to go back to Chile to look for more opportunities in this emerging market.</p>
<p>Over the next couple of years, I taught entrepreneurship in Chile, mentored local entrepreneurs and eventually started investing in Latin American companies myself. I’ve now invested in more than 30 early-stage companies in Latin America, and I firmly believe the time to help early-stage <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/services/startup-consulting/\" title=\"StartUp\" target=\"_blank\">StartUp</a>s in Latin America has never been better. Here’s why.</p>
<h2>Pioneer VC firms have paved the way for others to invest confidently in the region</h2>
<p>Some of the earliest VC firms established in the region, such as <span>NXTP Labs</span><span> in Argentina and </span><span>Vox Capital</span><span> in Brazil, have paved the way for others to find success. In a region that is traditionally very averse to risk and tends to condemn failure, these firms took a chance on budding ventures long before others dreamed of doing so.</span></p>
<p>These pioneer VC firms in the region faced plenty of challenges. First, they had to educate and develop the expectations of local entrepreneurs so that they realized that Latin America is not Silicon Valley, with easy access to venture capital and U.S.-style valuations. But their successes and failures have served as exemplary models for many of the new early-stage funding initiatives we’re seeing.</p>
<p>As the <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/services/startup-consulting/\" title=\"StartUp\" target=\"_blank\">StartUp</a> ecosystem in Latin America evolved, the flow and ease of doing early-stage deals improved significantly and encouraged more investment in the region. A look into <span>five-year investment trends</span><span> in Latin America revealed that investors had closed deals worth $2.3 billion, according to the Latin American Venture Capital Association (LAVCA).</span></p>
<p>In the past few years, we’ve also started to see VC-backed <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/services/startup-consulting/\" title=\"StartUp\" target=\"_blank\">StartUp</a>s begin to give back to the community and participate as investors themselves, either as angels or limited partners in funds. <span>One example is Colombian-American entrepreneur-turned-investor, </span><span>Andrés Barreto</span><span>. He launched several <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/services/startup-consulting/\" title=\"StartUp\" target=\"_blank\">StartUp</a>s, including Grooveshark and PulsoSocial, and, in 2012, he started the investment firm </span><span>Socialatom Ventures</span><span>. The Colombian firm, which recently raised a second fund called </span><span>Firstrock Capital</span><span>, invests in early-stage companies and provides them with resources to grow their companies.</span></p>
<p>The firm is still active and now focuses on early-stage <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/services/startup-consulting/\" title=\"StartUp\" target=\"_blank\">StartUp</a>s that have their technology team in Latin America but whose target market is the U.S. <span>(Disclosure: My firm, </span><span>Magma Partners</span><span>, has participated in two co-investments with Socialatom Ventures.)</span></p>
<h2>Local accelerators attract resources</h2>
<p>There’s no debating that the proliferation of accelerators and local entrepreneurs gaining experience in each of the key <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/services/startup-consulting/\" title=\"StartUp\" target=\"_blank\">StartUp</a> hubs across Latin America — such as in Buenos Aires, Santiago and Medellín — has impacted the region’s funding ecosystem as a whole.</p>
<div><blockquote>There’s never been a better time than now to be involved with the Latin American <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/services/startup-consulting/\" title=\"StartUp\" target=\"_blank\">StartUp</a> scene.</blockquote></div>
<p>A <span>2014 study</span><span> of accelerators found that just the presence of an accelerator can have an impact on the number of seed and early-stage VC deals in a local <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/services/startup-consulting/\" title=\"StartUp\" target=\"_blank\">StartUp</a> ecosystem. This “spillover effect” is certainly something I’ve witnessed in Latin America.</span><span> The growing number of early-stage accelerator programs, such as </span><span>Start-Up Chile</span><span> and Wayra, have had a lot to do with putting the region on the map as a hotspot for <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/services/startup-consulting/\" title=\"StartUp\" target=\"_blank\">StartUp</a> activity. These programs are showing outside investors that Latin America possesses abundant opportunities worth exploring.</span></p><div><div></div></div>
<h2><span>Fintech <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/services/startup-consulting/\" title=\"StartUp\" target=\"_blank\">StartUp</a>s are driving investment activity </span></h2>
<p><a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/services/startup-consulting/\" title=\"StartUp\" target=\"_blank\">StartUp</a>s are disrupting all sectors of the economy, but the main sector of Latin America witnessing the most change is the traditional banking industry. Because there is still such a large unbanked population in the region, fintech <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/services/startup-consulting/\" title=\"StartUp\" target=\"_blank\">StartUp</a>s are discovering plenty of opportunities to succeed.</p>
<p>According to <span>Finnovista</span><span>, the number of fintech <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/services/startup-consulting/\" title=\"StartUp\" target=\"_blank\">StartUp</a>s in the region recently surpassed 1,000. Strategic partners in traditional businesses and regulatory approval from government, along with funding for the initial stages, are needed to scale these companies both locally and globally, and investors are on board. </span><span><br></span></p>
<p><span>LAVCA showed <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/services/startup-consulting/\" title=\"StartUp\" target=\"_blank\">StartUp</a>s in the fintech sector received more investment in </span><span>2015</span><span> than any other <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/services/startup-consulting/\" title=\"StartUp\" target=\"_blank\">StartUp</a> sector in the region. Fintech accounted for almost </span><span>30 percent</span><span> of the entire IT sector’s investment in 2015, and </span><span>40 percent</span><span> in the first half of 2016.</span></p>
<p>The global <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/services/startup-consulting/\" title=\"StartUp\" target=\"_blank\">StartUp</a> network <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/services/startup-consulting/\" title=\"StartUp\" target=\"_blank\">StartUp</a>bootcamp recently <span>announced its expansion</span><span> to Latin America by launching a dedicated fintech program in Mexico in a joint effort with Finnovista. </span><span>Over the past four years, Finnovista </span><span>claims</span><span> they’ve witnessed how fintech <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/services/startup-consulting/\" title=\"StartUp\" target=\"_blank\">StartUp</a>s have shaped financial services in the region and recognized that these companies cannot scale by themselves. The program aims to provide fintech <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/services/startup-consulting/\" title=\"StartUp\" target=\"_blank\">StartUp</a>s in Mexico, and beyond, access to the funding and mentorship needed to grow their companies.</span></p>
<p><span>Seedstars</span><span>, too, traveled around Latin America over the past few years to find top entrepreneurs and connect them with global investors and partners. </span><span>This year</span><span>, focus has been on fintech innovations coming out of the region. Colombian crowd factoring <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/services/startup-consulting/\" title=\"StartUp\" target=\"_blank\">StartUp</a> </span><span>Mesfix</span><span> and Brazilian financial planning services <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/services/startup-consulting/\" title=\"StartUp\" target=\"_blank\">StartUp</a> </span><span>QueroQuitar</span><span> were selected as finalists to present at the </span><span>Seedstars Summit.</span></p>

Momentum is building, with success stories like <span>Brazil’s Nubank</span><span> and </span><span>Argentina’s IguanaFix</span><span> becoming a regular occurrence, and there’s never been a better time than now to be involved with the Latin American <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/services/startup-consulting/\" title=\"StartUp\" target=\"_blank\">StartUp</a> scene.</span></p>
