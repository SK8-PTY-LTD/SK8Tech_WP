  <p><em>Spider-Man: Homecoming </em>is due out this summer, and I’m pretty excited. Tom Holland proved himself to be an incredibly solid Peter Parker in <em>Captain America: Civil War,</em> and even though it’s the third solo Spidey reboot in 15 years, Marvel Studios’ influence (and a good dash of Robert Downey, Jr.’s charm) has me cautiously optimistic that this new take on the character will be a welcome addition to what’s becoming a fun year in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.</p>
<p>I mean look at this poster:</p>

<p>Here’s why I love this image: Peter Parker is being a complete dork. Who else but nerdy, nebbishy Peter would think that wearing what looks like his school blazer over his costume looks cool? Who listens to music <em>through </em>their mask? You just know he’s listening to <em>Radiola</em><em>b.</em> Parker is a dweeb, and that’s probably the best part of his character. (<em>Radiolab</em> is great, too.)</p>
<p>With <em>Homecoming</em>, <em>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2</em>, and <em>Thor: Ragnarok </em>all coming out this year, Marvel is leaning hard into just having fun with superheroes. It’s the anti-DC Universe. The sky is blue, the skyline <em>isn’t</em> on fire!</p>
<p>We’re now in a nice little rest period between the comparatively sullen <em>Civil War </em>and the next <em>Avengers </em>slugfest. It’s nice. I like my superhero movies with a little joy in them. <em>Spider-Man: Homecoming </em>hits theaters on July 7th.</p>      <div>
