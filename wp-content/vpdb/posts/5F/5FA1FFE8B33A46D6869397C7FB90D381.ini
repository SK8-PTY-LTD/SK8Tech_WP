Americans waste 1 trillion gallons of water every year thanks to leaky faucets, faulty sprinkler systems and other small systems. Utilis’ tech can find leaks to systems that are much bigger, serving urban markets, and help utilities to repair them before the waste has a detrimental effect on people living nearby.</p><p>Each year, IH2O rallies tech startups to develop solutions for particular problems around our global water supply. This year’s theme was simply, “data.” IH2O President Scott Bryan said, “Data is a building block you must have in water. Communities cannot make big decisions around a desalination plant if they don’t have data about leaks, or how much energy it may takes to move water from point a to point b, for example. Without data you can’t plan, and you can’t do things, big things, in water.”</p><p>Judges at the IH2O annual event ranged from Silicon Valley <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/tag/venture/\" title=\"Venture\">Venture</a> investors to technologists from water utilities and large industrials, to sustainability experts and policy makers. All 12 companies invited to be finalists in this competition were accepted into the IH2O accelerator. But Utilis also scored a cash prize of $25,000 and will have the option of free business <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/tag/services/\" title=\"Services\">Services</a> and mentorship provided by partners of IH2O.</p><p>The announcement of the winning water tech innovators fell on a date when President Donald Trump sent an aggressive budget to Congress seeking to dramatically cut funding for the E.P.A., and the United Nations both of which are running multiple initiatives to study and conserve the world’s clean water supply. For example, the E.P.A. runs regional projects like the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative. And the United Nations recognizes access to safe and clean drinking water and water for sanitation are human rights.</p><div><div></div></div><p>That budget is getting pushback. But no matter the outcome, it’s at least heartening to know that if the U.S. government stops supporting such initiatives financially, and otherwise, some (if too few) private sector organizations are banding together to find technological approaches to water conservation, and protection.</p><div style=\"width: 748px\"><img src=\"<<[site-url]>>/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Utilis-takes-top-water-innovation-prize-at-Imagine-H2O-for-tech-that-finds-leaks-underground.jpg\" width=\"738\" height=\"492\" srcset=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/utilis_ih2o_2017_water_tech.jpg?w=738&amp;h=492 738w, https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/utilis_ih2o_2017_water_tech.jpg?w=150&amp;h=100 150w, https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/utilis_ih2o_2017_water_tech.jpg?w=300&amp;h=200 300w, https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/utilis_ih2o_2017_water_tech.jpg?w=768&amp;h=512 768w, https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/utilis_ih2o_2017_water_tech.jpg?w=680&amp;h=453 680w, https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/utilis_ih2o_2017_water_tech.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 738px) 100vw, 738px\" alt=\"Utilis takes top water innovation prize at Imagine H2O for tech that finds leaks underground\"><p>Utilis co-founders at the Imagine H2O Water Gala 2017 in San Francisco.</p></div><p><em>A list of all the other water-tech startups participating in the accelerator follows below. Descriptions provided by IH2O.</em></p><ul>
