All the slices would be reassembled in a 3D model that researchers can dive into and manipulate in virtual reality.</p><p>3D scans of tumors and other cancerous growths already exist, of course, but this would provide much greater detail and interactivity.</p><div><div></div></div><p><span style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe type=\"text/html\" width=\"640\" height=\"390\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/a8mZqcmRJrk?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p><p>“I think this is the very cutting edge of how people will in the future understand not only cancer but organismal development,” said Hannon in a video from the university. “All sorts of biological problems happen in 3D, and they happen in 3D with cells communicating with each other in ways that we really don’t yet capture with any technology that we’ve developed so far.”</p><p>The team pitched the project to the Cancer Research UK’s Grand Challenge, which awards £20 million grants to cutting-edge efforts like this one. In this case, it will be awarded over a six-year period — hopefully enough time to develop some of the tech needed to bring it about.</p>"
