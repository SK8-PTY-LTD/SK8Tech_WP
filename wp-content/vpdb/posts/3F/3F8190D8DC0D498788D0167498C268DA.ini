The decision to revert to archaic tech is troubling, but for FOIA filers, another layer of obfuscation is just business as usual. However, the portal’s new terms of service will let you send an unlimited number of requests.</p><p><strong>4. </strong>Google officially launched Android Wear 2.0, the biggest update to the company’s wearable OS since its launch in 2014. The updated version feels a lot like the next logical evolution, and the OS is launching on two new flagship watches from LG.</p><p><strong>5. </strong>Jawbone has run out of money. The fitness band maker that originally started out in headsets and speakers will stop selling consumer hardware in favor of a new business model and manufacturing health devices. Jawbone is also trying to raise more money for this new endeavor.</p><p><img src=\"<<[site-url]>>/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Weekly-Roundup-Tech-companies-rally-against-Trump8217s-immigration-ban-Zenefits-cuts-workforce-again-1.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"364\" srcset=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/podesta-newsletter.jpg 640w, https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/podesta-newsletter.jpg?w=150&amp;h=85 150w, https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/podesta-newsletter.jpg?w=300&amp;h=171 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" alt=\"Weekly Roundup: Tech companies rally against Trump&amp;#8217;s immigration ban, Zenefits cuts workforce again\"></p><div><div></div></div><p><strong>6. </strong>Former Democratic campaigner John Podesta has spoken up about the WikiLeaks email hack that occurred in the final month before the 2016 election.
