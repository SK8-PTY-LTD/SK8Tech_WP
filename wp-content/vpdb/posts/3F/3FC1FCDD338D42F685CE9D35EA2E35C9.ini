  <p>By now you've certainly seen LG's new flagship phone, the G6. But did you know that the phone's features differ depending upon where you buy it? The differences affect audio quality, charging convenience, and even storage options. LG carved up the options based upon what it thinks its customers want in each region of the planet. Makes me wonder if they got it right?</p>

<p>If you're in South Korea, for example, then you'll be treated to 64GBs of storage and a quad DAC capable of delivering higher-quality audio from the headphone jack. Koreans won't get wireless charging though; that's a feature reserved for buyers only in the US who, conversely, won't get a quad DAC or the choice of a beefier 64GB phone. Europeans get nothing: no quad DAC, no wireless charging, and no 64GB model — the European G6 maxes out at 32GB just like the US. Some other Asian regions, like India, will also get the 64GB model.</p>
<p>So I'm curious. Of these options, which do you prioritize the highest?</p>

    <h4>The LG G6 is sleek, solid, and surprisingly sensible</h4>

<p>LG has offered four 32-bit digital-to-analog converters from ESS on both the V20 and the V10 that preceded it. The G6's quartet of DACs are supposed to improve upon those. Good thing, too, because Chris Welch \"didn’t notice much difference\" between the audio played on the V20 review unit and his iPhone. Maybe you will, but you'll need decent wired headphones, quality music sources, and an environment free of ambient noise to properly exploit the capability.</p>      <div>

<p>The US version of the G6, meanwhile, supports both Qi and PMA wireless charging. That's a big convenience to those of you with ready access to charging pads in your cars, offices, cafes, and homes. The storage limitation is at least offset by the G6's microSD expansion option, but some of you will certainly desire 64GB of ultra-fast flash memory baked right into your handset.</p>
<p>Choices, choices. The other option is to just wait for LG's unannounced V-series phone which LG suggests will be sold without any regional compromises. But let's keep things focused on the G6 for now, shall we?</p>
