  <p>Have you ever loved something so much that you’ve used it for over a decade? A love as strong as Chris Plante’s love for the Sennheiser HD 650 headphones in his eulogy for the perfect headphones? I honestly can’t say I have. It’s so rare that we hold onto <em>anything </em>for that long, much less gadgets. How many smartphones have you gone through in the last decade? </p>
