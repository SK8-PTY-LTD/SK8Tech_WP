        </figure><p>Chinese drone maker DJI is offering up to one million yuan (£112,000) for information about drones that disrupted scores of flights at a Chinese airport.</p><p>On four days this month - 14, 17, 18 and 21 - drones were blamed for stranding thousands of passengers at Chengdu Shuangliu International.</p><p>Chinese reports said they caused 60 flight interruptions on 21 April alone.</p><p>One expert said it showed how difficult it is to combat unsafe drone flights.</p><p>Initially, it was reported that a reward of 10,000 yuan (£1,124) had been offered by the local public security bureau for information about unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) flown near to the transport hub.</p><div aria-hidden=\"true\">

</div><p>However, DJI is now proposing a much bigger bounty.</p><p>In a press release in Chinese, the firm said that flying drones so close to an airport was a serious threat to public safety - and also damaged the UAV industry's image.</p><p>Members of the public have until 31 December to make a report to local authorities.</p><h2>'Extraordinary measures'</h2><p>The bounty was a sign that the firm was taking the potential impact on its reputation seriously, suggested Prof David Dunn at the University of Birmingham.</p><p>\"Clearly they're concerned about their brand image, given how much they dominate the drone market,\" he told the BBC.</p><p>Prof Dunn pointed out that using on-board software to restrict where drones can fly - known as geofencing, which DJI uses in its drones - was not always successful.</p><p>\"There seems to be an inability to deal with the potential drone threat to air traffic - other than through extraordinary measures like this reward,\" he said. </p>
