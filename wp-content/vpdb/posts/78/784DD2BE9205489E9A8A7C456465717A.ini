They will have about $250 million in capital to deploy, an increase from the $200 million in their previous late stage fund from 2.5 years ago.</p><p>This is in addition to the $200 million early stage fund that they recently raised late last year. About half of their growth fund investments will be follow-on rounds for existing portfolio companies.</p><p>Some of their later stage investments include Thrive Market, app-annie-raises-63-million-in-series-e-funding/\">App Annie</a> and app-annie-raises-63-million-in-series-e-funding/\">Plated</a>. A handful of their startups have been successfully acquired including Buddy Media, Trunk Club, Braintree and Maker Studios.</p><p>With the fund announcement also comes the promotion of Dylan Pearce, who is graduating from principal to partner. Pearce is involved with managing the day-to-day operations of the growth stage funds.</p><p>While many venture firms focus on a particular phase, Greycroft wants to be “stage agnostic,” Pearce says.  This can mean anywhere from that initial seed round to a pre-IPO opportunity.</p><div><div></div></div><p>Greycroft also takes a different approach from other venture firms when it comes to location. While they make some investments in Silicon Valley, they are headquartered in Los Angeles and New York, with a particular focus on global opportunities.</p><p> </p><p>Greycroft was founded in 2006 by Alan Patricof,  Ian Sigalow and Dana Settle.</p>"
