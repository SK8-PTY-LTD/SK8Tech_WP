  <p>We’ve already gotten a good look at the Samsung Galaxy S8, but a new leaked image of the device shows off the colors that will be available when it ships to consumers in April. </p>
<p>The image comes from Evan Blass, who leaked the first images of the phone back in January. His new image reveals that Samsung’s next flagship phone will be available in three colors: black sky, orchid grey, and arctic silver. </p>
