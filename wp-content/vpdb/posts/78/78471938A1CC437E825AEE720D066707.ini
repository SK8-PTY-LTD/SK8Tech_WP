Often, he said, attackers burrowed deeper into a company's infrastructure to find key databases that were then scrambled before payment was sought.</p><p>In most attacks, booby-trapped attachments sent via email were the main delivery mechanism for ransomware and other malware, found the report. </p><p>\"These attacks are all about getting a foothold on a system,\" he said, adding that once attackers were inside an organisation they typically looked to use the back doors for many different types of attack.</p><p>Darren Thomson, chief technology officer for Symantec in Europe, said its statistics suggest about one in every 131 email messages was now harbouring some kind of cyber-threat.</p><p>\"They are arriving in Word documents and Excel spreadsheets,\" he said, \"the messages people get many times a day.\"</p><p>The Verizon report also spotted a shift in the targets of cyber-attacks with 61% of victims now being companies with fewer than 1,000 employees.</p><p>The good news, said Mr Spitler, was that some industry sectors that had been hit hard before, now appeared less often in its attack statistics - suggesting their digital defences were starting to work.</p><p>\"The lack of large retailers suffering point-of-sale intrusions was a glimmer of hope,\" he said. </p>
