Gates told the Mirror: \"We don't have cell phones at the table when we are having a meal.\" </p><p>This seems eminently sane. When the art of conversation has been replaced by the art of picking which smiley face to add to your text, you know that civilization is in trouble.</p><p>Gates' phone policy is surely a rarity. Go to any family dinner table, restaurant or bar and you'll see many, many people talking, but not talking, as they clutch their phones like Linus clutched his blanket. Family members even text each other when they're in the same house. </p><p>But it's all going to be so much better very soon, at least if you believe Facebook. We'll forget our phones entirely. We'll communicate through our glasses instead.</p>
