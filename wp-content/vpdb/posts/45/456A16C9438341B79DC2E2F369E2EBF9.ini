</p><p>In the world of music, rockstars party while MCs invest.</p><p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Following the launch of Jay Z’s new VC vehicle, Arrive, earlier this month, we did a data pull on how music industry moguls spend their ducats. And hip hop artists are way ahead of rock stars when it comes to making tech investments, according to an analysis of Crunchbase data.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">There are more than a dozen app/lists/hip-hop-pop-musicians-and-startups/1c98e72e-d067-4af6-9299-f75613d2c33f/identifier?new=false\">hip hop and pop stars in the Crunchbase dataset</a> who have invested in startups. Several of them have only done one deal or last invested years ago. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">About six, however, are pretty consistent investors or are deeply enmeshed in the tech scene.  Rock stars, by contrast, weren’t prolific investors, with the occasional exception like U2’s Bono, a co-founder of media and technology investment firm Elevation Partners. </span></p><div><div></div></div><p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">On the hip hop and pop side, here’s a rundown on the top celebrity investors and the deals they’ve done.</span></p><div>

<b>Snoop Dogg: </b><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Snoop’s portfolio is interesting  because it contains investments in both cannabis and caffeine. It remains a matter of medical debate whether these two substances are a complementary or toxic combination. As investments, however, both appear to be growth sectors. Snoop is a co-founder of </span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Merry Jane</span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">, a media site for the cannabis lifestyle, and a founder of </span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Casa Verde Capital</span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">, an investment firm that has backed marijuana delivery service Eaze and pot packaging provider </span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">FunkSac</span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">. He’s also a backer of <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/services/content-marketing/\" title=\"Social Media\" target=\"_blank\">Social Media</a> site </span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Reddit</span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> and invested in the chain </span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Philz Coffee</span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">, sports content <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/services/startup-consulting/\" title=\"StartUp\" target=\"_blank\">StartUp</a> </span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">GameOn </span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">and commission-free stock buying platform </span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Robinhood</span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">.</span>
</li>
<li>
<b>Will.i.am: </b><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Though still most famous as a rapper, musician and founding member of the Black Eyed Peas, Will.i.am is well known in techie circles too. He’s founder of </span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">i.am+</span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> , a Hollywood-based technology company that developed a smartband and recently rolled out hip-looking bluetooth earphones. He’s also made investments in </span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Honest Dollar</span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">, a retirement savings <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/tag/app/\" title=\"App\">App</a> and <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/services/startup-consulting/\" title=\"StartUp\" target=\"_blank\">StartUp</a> incubator </span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Shellanoo Group</span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">, according to Crunchbase.</span>
</li>
<li>
<b>Nas:</b><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> In addition to selling millions of records, Nasir bin Olu Dara Jones, better known as Nas, has been a remarkably prolific investor, holding stakes in at least 42 startups, according to Crunchbase. Like Snoop, he’s invested in Philz Coffee and Robinhood. More recent investments include </span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">DoseDr</span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">, a mobile <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/tag/app/\" title=\"App\">App</a> for diabetics, and </span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Exo</span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">, a maker of protein bars containing cricket flour.  In addition to making personal investments, Nas is a partner at </span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">QueensBridge <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/tag/venture/\" title=\"Venture\">Venture</a> Partners</span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">, a Los Angeles-based early stage tech investor.</span>
</li>
<li>
<b>Chamillionaire:  </b><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Much like his musical career, Hakeem “Chamillionaire” Seriki’s turn as a <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/tag/venture/\" title=\"Venture\">Venture</a> investor started out on a very lucrative note. He participated in a $1.5 million Series A round for digital media talent scout </span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Maker Studios</span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> in 2010. The company sold to Disney a few years later for upwards of $500 million. Chamillionaire liked <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/tag/venture/\" title=\"Venture\">Venture</a> capital so much, he signed on as an entrepreneur-in-residence at Los Angeles VC firm </span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Upfront Ventures</span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> two years ago.</span>
</li>
<li>
<b>John Legend:  </b><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">The Grammy-winning R&amp;B singer is a co-founder of </span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Bungalow Clothing</span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">, a seed-funded online clothes shopping service that pairs customers with personal stylists.  He also invested in a Series A round for </span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Thrive Market</span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">, a socially conscious online food retailer, and </span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Gobbler</span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">, which offers media project management tools.</span>
</li>
<li>
<b>Jay Z:  </b><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">The rapper and business mogul has both a large portfolio of investments and a track record for generating exits or big follow-on rounds. In January, Sprint bought a 33 percent stake in </span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Tida</span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">l, the online music service he co-founded, paying around $200 million according to some media outlets. He also participated in a $5.2 million Series A round for air travel <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/services/startup-consulting/\" title=\"StartUp\" target=\"_blank\">StartUp</a> </span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">JetSmarter</span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">, which closed on $105 million in Series C funding in December. His entertainment company, </span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Roc Nation</span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">, has made a number of early stage investments too, leading to its involvement this month in the launch of </span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Arrive</span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">, a platform for developing and funding startups.</span>
</li>
</ul><p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Jay Z isn’t the only one on the active investor list who has invested in early stage companies that have gone on to raise larger rounds. Snoop, for instance, joined a $10 million round for Eaze in 2015, and company went on to close a $13 round the next year. Legend,  meanwhile, participated in a $33 million round for Thrive, which went on to raise $110 million a year later. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Still, when it comes to return multiples, it will be hard for anyone to top Chamillionaire’s Maker Studios investment. If he keeps making those kinds of deals, many are predicting he’ll have to change his name to Chabillionaire.</span></p><small>Featured Image: Jewel Samad/Getty Images</small>"
