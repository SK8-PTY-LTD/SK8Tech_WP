</div><p>The 2016 winner was created by Dr Jochen Viehoff and Johannes Blobel for the HNF and is built of a simplified model of one small component of Eniac known as the accumulator. The original Eniac filled several rooms and weighed about 27 tonnes. </p><p>The exhibit uses two accumulators, cables, relays and flashing lights to show how complicated it was to perform simple calculations on the early computer. </p><p>Eniac was the second general-purpose electronic computer created in the 1940s and won wide acclaim because the machine that was first, called Colossus, remained a state secret until the 1970s.</p><p>Prof Martin Campbell-Kelly from the University of Warwick, who headed the award's panel of judges, said the exhibit \"captured the essence\" of the Eniac. </p><p>\"The panel was particularly impressed at the thought and planning that went into making the reconstruction accessible to non-specialist audiences,\" he said.</p><p>Visitors to the HNF would be \"captivated\" by the exhibit, he said.</p><p>Previous winners include a virtual reconstruction of the German Z1 computer and a museum exhibit that explored the history of IBM's influential 1401 machine. </p>
