Inkjets have always kind of annoyed me, in part due to their expensive, low-capacity ink cartridges... OK, entirely due to that. And when an ink cartridge dries up because it hasn't been used for a few weeks, and have no choice but to replace it? <em>Cheapskate-rage!</em></p><p>So what do I mean by \"about the same price\"? For a limited time, and while supplies last, Staples has the Dell C1760nw color laser printer for $74.99 shipped plus tax. Price elsewhere: at least $125. Technically this is an LED printer, but the end result is the same. Tomato, tomahto. <strong>Update:</strong> <em>Aaaaand...sold out already. Ugh. Sorry, gang.</em></p><p>Before I delve into that, let me mention that Staples also has the Dell E310dw monochrome laser printer for $49.99 shipped and the Dell E525w all-in-one color laser for $139.99 shipped. Those are equally excellent deals, though on rare occasion I've seen the latter for $10-20 less. </p><p>Let me also mention that Staples historically runs out of inventory very quickly when running deals like this, so I hope you're able to get one if you want one.</p>
                            
                
                                
                                            


<div data-ad=\"inpage-video-top\">
        </div>                        <p>The C1760nw is about as compact a color laser as I've seen, and in fact its input tray holds only 150 sheets -- not ideal for an office, but okay for home use.</p><p>It offers all the key connectivity options: USB, Ethernet and Wi-Fi, though if you want to print from an Android or iOS device, you'll have to use Dell's app -- the machine doesn't support AirPrint or Google Cloud Print.</p><p>It's always important to check the cost of consumables, and I'm happy to report you can buy an entire set of third-party toner cartridges for as little as $39 -- or a high-yield set for just a few bucks more. As you well know, a set of ink cartridges usually costs at least that much, but toner tends to stretch a <em>lot </em>farther. So in the end, a laser costs a lot less to operate.</p><p>CNET hasn't reviewed the C1760nw, but reviews elsewhere peg it as \"pretty good.\" Around 130 Staples customers rated it 4.4 stars on average, and it scored a 4.2 from Amazon buyers.</p>
                            
                
                                
                                            


<div data-ad=\"replay-wide-top\">
        </div>                        <p>My advice: Toss your inkjet and embrace the awesomeness that is a color laser. This is a stellar deal.</p><p><strong>Bonus deal: </strong>If you frequently find yourself thinking, \"My phone's camera just isn't cutting it,\" consider investing in a DLSR. Like this one: Today only, and while supplies last, Meh has the Canon EOS Rebel T6 for for $384, plus $5 for shipping. Price nearly everywhere else: $449. It comes with an 18-55mm lens and has overwhelmingly positive user ratings -- though I will note that professional reviewers (such as CNET's Lori Grunin) were a little less kind. Of course, it was $500 when reviewed. A few flaws are perhaps easier to overlook $116 later?</p>
