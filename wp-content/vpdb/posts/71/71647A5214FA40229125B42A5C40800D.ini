	<p>On May 22, 2010,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/may-22-bitcoin-pizza-day-2014-5?IR=T\" target=\"_blank\">a developer bought two pizzas</a>&nbsp;using 10,000 units of a then-little-known digital currency called bitcoin.</p><p>Today, 10,000 bitcoins are worth more than $20 million.</p><p>Bitcoin is going nuclear.&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.coindesk.com/price/\" target=\"_blank\">Its price is tearing upward, with each bitcoin worth $2,128</a>&nbsp;-- a little shy of its all-time-high of $2,185 reached earlier Monday morning.</p><p>Just a year ago, it was trading at just $443, after deflating from what was then seen as the giddy highs of about $1,100&nbsp;in late 2013. It has since embarked on an epic bull run.</p><p>&quot;The Japanese have caught the Bitcoin bug and inefficiencies across markets are being exposed,&quot; CryptoCompare founder Charles Hayter said in an emailed comment. &quot;Irrational exuberance is taking hold as the Japanese stumble over each other to enter the Bitcoin market and drag up international prices.&quot;</p><p>The digital currency has come a long way since 2010, when the purchase of the two Papa John&#39;s pizzas by Laszlo Hanyecz from another bitcoin enthusiast marked what is believed to be the first &quot;real-world&quot; bitcoin transaction.</p><p>He posted on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=137.0\" target=\"_blank\">the Bitcoin Talk forum on May 22, 2010, writing</a>:</p><p style=\"margin-left:40px\">&quot;I&#39;ll pay 10,000 bitcoins for a couple of pizzas.. like maybe 2 large ones so I have some left over for the next day. I like having left over pizza to nibble on later. You can make the pizza yourself and bring it to my house or order it for me from a delivery place, but what I&#39;m aiming for is getting food delivered in exchange for bitcoins where I don&#39;t have to order or prepare it myself, kind of like ordering a &#39;breakfast platter&#39; at a hotel or something, they just bring you something to eat and you&#39;re happy!</p><p style=\"margin-left:40px\">&quot;I like things like onions, peppers, sausage, mushrooms, tomatoes, pepperoni, etc.. just standard stuff no weird fish topping or anything like that. I also like regular cheese pizzas which may be cheaper to prepare or otherwise acquire.</p><p style=\"margin-left:40px\">&quot;If you&#39;re interested please let me know and we can work out a deal.&quot;</p><p>Ten thousand coins were then worth about $40. A British user agreed to buy the pizza for him, and even at the time the buyer got a good deal out of it: The person paid only $25 for the two pizzas.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-pizza-day-celebrating-pizza-bought-10000-btc/\" target=\"_blank\">The date is a marked on an annual basis by bitcoin users as</a>&nbsp;&quot;Bitcoin Pizza Day.&quot;</p><p>Today, 10,000 bitcoins add up to about&nbsp;$20.5 million.</p><blockquote data-lang=\"en\"><p>The <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash\">#Bitcoin</a> pizza is worth $20,509,958 today. (-0.15% from yesterday) Today is Bitcoin pizza day!</p>&mdash; Bitcoin Pizza (@bitcoin_pizza) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bitcoin_pizza/status/866477230570033157\">May 22, 2017</a></blockquote><script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script><p>&quot;It wasn&#39;t like Bitcoins had any value back then, so the idea of trading them for a pizza was incredibly cool,&quot;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/12/22/disruptions-betting-on-bitcoin/?_r=0\" target=\"_blank\">Hanyecz told <em>The New York Times</em> in 2013</a>. &quot;No one knew it was going to get so big.&quot;</p><p><a href=\"https://assets.entrepreneur.com/images/misc/1495465602_bitcoin-chart.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://assets.entrepreneur.com/images/misc/1495465602_bitcoin-chart.jpg\" style=\"height:900px; width:1800px\" alt=\"Someone in 2010 Bought 2 Pizzas With 10,000 Bitcoins -- Which Today Would Be Worth $20 Million\" /></a></p><div>Bitcoin is on an epic bull run, soaring to all-time highs.</div><div>Image credit: Coindesk</div><p><em>Get the latest Bitcoin price<a href=\"http://markets.businessinsider.com/currencies/BTC-USD\" target=\"_blank\">&nbsp;here.</a></em></p>
