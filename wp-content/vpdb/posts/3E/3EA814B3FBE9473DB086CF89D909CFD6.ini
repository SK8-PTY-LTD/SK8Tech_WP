  <p>Ever since Donald Glover shouted out Migos’ “Bad and Boujee” at the Golden Globes earlier this year, the song has topped charts and become an early contender for hit of 2017. That means it’s gonna be parodied, and with Disney’s live-action <em>Beauty and the Beast </em>remake hitting theaters soon, a mash-up was in order. <em>Nerdist </em>went all out for this video, and seeing Belle dab with her friends made my day.</p>
<p>Considering the film is only getting mildly positive reviews, I can say that reviving the classic has at least managed to encourage a creative send up or two. <em>Beauty and the Beast </em>debuts this Friday.</p>      <div>
