<p>There’s hardly anything that we haven’t tried putting machine learning to work at, and usually they take to it like a duck to water. That’s not the case here, with a neural network attempting to learn how to give paint colors those fancy names like “spring rain” and “harbor mist.” How would you like to paint your house in a nice “dorkwood” or “stanky bean”?</p>
<p>This unsuccessful attempt to replace the creatives in the paint-naming space was carried out by Janelle Shane, a researcher and flautist who occasionally “plays with neural networks.”</p>
<p>The network was given a list of 7,700 paint names and their corresponding RGB values, and set to work trying to suss out the hidden connections that govern these interesting yet occasionally obscure appellations.</p>
<p>At first things were promising, and the system seemed to be putting together a rudimentary logic, although it wasn’t using the “real” words for these colors.</p>

Could “Caae” correspond to the overall mid-level brightness? It isn’t intelligible to us, but perhaps this is the beginning of a robust internal artistic grammar?!</p>
<p>A few more runs through the data and the network was ready and willing to produce highly creative and original names for colors, far more adventurous than your garden-variety “greige” and “royal purple.” Let us survey the results.</p><div><div></div></div>

<p>Dondarf? Burble Simp? Bank butt? Catbabel?</p>
<p>Bunflow? Rose Hork? Dope? …Turdly?</p>
<p>Though I do quite like Stargoon and Caring Tan and Snowbonk, perhaps this particular intelligence needs a little more gestation time. Until that happens, you might thank Shane for her valuable work by re-tumblring and blowing up that all-important note count.</p>
