                    Many young girls are blogging about beauty and most of them are \"pretty and thin\", according to one academic

            </figcaption>
            
        </figure><h2>Pretty and thin</h2><p>Shauna Pomerantz, associate professor at the department of child and youth studies at Brock University in Ontario, Canada, says Nikki is a great role model for young girls.</p><p>\"She is the champion of the not-perfect girl, and she is absolutely inspirational to watch,\" she told the BBC. </p><p>\"I can see why people love her - she is a hero to anyone who feels like an outsider.\"</p><p>Across the pond, 13-year-old American dancer and singer JoJo Siwa vlogs about much the same thing as Nikki Lilly, although, with more than three million followers, she is better established.</p><p>There are, says Prof Pomerantz, thousands of similar girls on YouTube and they are \"mostly white, upper-class, pretty and thin\".</p><p>Prof Pomerantz's own nine-year-old daughter is a mega-fan of JoJo's, and while her daughter doesn't know why she likes her so much, her mother thinks there are two main reasons.</p><p>\"Firstly, this is a world where no adults are visible and it is fantastic for children to see a world where kids are in charge.\"</p><figure>
