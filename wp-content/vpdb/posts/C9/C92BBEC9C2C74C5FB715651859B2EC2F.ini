</div><p>It said they had made efforts to tackle abuse and extremism on their platforms, but \"nowhere near enough is being done\". </p><p>The committee said it had found \"repeated examples of <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/services/content-marketing/\" title=\"Social Media\" target=\"_blank\">Social Media</a> companies failing to remove illegal content when asked to do so\".</p><p>It said the largest firms were \"big enough, rich enough and clever enough\" to sort the problem out, and that it was \"shameful\" that they had failed to use the same ingenuity to protect public safety as they had to protect their own income.</p><hr><h2>\"White Genocide\" and \"Ban Islam\"</h2><p>Among the examples the committee found were:</p><ul>
<li>Twitter refused to remove a cartoon depicting male ethnic minority migrants abusing a semi-naked white woman while stabbing her baby to death on the grounds it was not in breach of its \"hateful conduct policy\"</li>
<li>YouTube refused to remove a video entitled \"Jews admit organizing White Genocide\" on the basis it \"did not cross the line into hate speech\"</li>
<li>On Facebook there were openly anti-Semitic and Islamophobic community pages such as \"Ban Islam\". Facebook removed some posts but not the community pages themselves because its policy allows criticism of religion, but not hate against people because of their religion</li>
</ul><hr><p>The MPs said it was \"unacceptable\" that <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/services/content-marketing/\" title=\"Social Media\" target=\"_blank\">Social Media</a> companies relied on users to report content, saying they were \"outsourcing\" the role \"at zero expense\".</p><p>Yet the companies expected the police - funded by the taxpayer - to bear the costs of keeping them clean of extremism.</p><p>The report's recommendations include:</p><ul>
<li>The government should consult on requiring <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/services/content-marketing/\" title=\"Social Media\" target=\"_blank\">Social Media</a> firms to contribute to the cost of the police's counter-terrorism internet referral unit</li>
<li>It should also consult on \"meaningful fines\" for companies which failed to remove illegal content within a strict timeframe, highlighting proposals in Germany which could see firms fined up to £44m and individual executives £5m</li>
<li><a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/services/content-marketing/\" title=\"Social Media\" target=\"_blank\">Social Media</a> companies review urgently their community standards and how they are being interpreted and implemented</li>
</ul><p>\"<a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/services/content-marketing/\" title=\"Social Media\" target=\"_blank\">Social Media</a> companies' failure to deal with illegal and dangerous material online is a disgrace,\" said committee chairwoman Yvette Cooper.</p><p>Ms Cooper said the committee's inquiry into hate crime more broadly was curtailed when the general election was called and their recommendations had to be limited to dealing with <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/services/content-marketing/\" title=\"Social Media\" target=\"_blank\">Social Media</a> companies and online hate.</p><figure>
