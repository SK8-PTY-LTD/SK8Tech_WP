But while it was up, the fast food chain (or whoever had access to its social accounts) even went so far as pinning the bold proclamation to the top of its page for good measure.</p><p><img src=\"<<[site-url]>>/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/20170316_58caa935d7180.jpg\" width=\"456\" height=\"295\" srcset=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/mcdonaldtrump.jpg 456w, https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/mcdonaldtrump.jpg?w=150&amp;h=97 150w, https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/mcdonaldtrump.jpg?w=300&amp;h=194 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 456px) 100vw, 456px\" alt=\"McDonald’s serves up one more, calling Trump a ‘disgusting excuse of a President’ on Twitter\"></p><p>The note has no doubt hit Trump where it hurt, turning his dual loves of Twitter and fast food against him in a way that no mainstream media wonk has been able to do thus far.
