</figure><p>Members of the British public are getting their first extended trial of a driverless shuttle bus.</p><p>Over the next three weeks, about 100 people will travel in a prototype shuttle on a route in Greenwich, London. </p><p>The vehicle, which travels up to 10mph (16.1kmph), will be controlled by a computer. </p><p>However, there will be a trained person on board who can stop the shuttle if required during the tests.</p><p>Oxbotica, the firm that developed the technology behind the shuttle, said 5,000 people had applied to take part.</p><div aria-hidden=\"true\">

</div><p>\"Very few people have experienced an autonomous vehicle, so this is about letting people see one in person,\" chief executive Graeme Smith told the BBC.</p><p>\"We hope to gain acceptance from members of the public for vehicles sharing this kind of space with them.</p><p>\"We are also looking at how people in the vehicle respond when being transported from A to B.\"</p><h2>'Fail-safe'</h2><p>The shuttle seats four people and has no steering wheel or brake pedal. </p><p>During the trial, five cameras and three lasers will help it navigate a two-mile riverside path near London's O2 Arena, an area also used by pedestrians and cyclists.</p><figure>
