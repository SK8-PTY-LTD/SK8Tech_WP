However, this is definitely not as handy as some of the independent websites that provide this information to you with just a few clicks, including the newer resistance-focused <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/tag/services/\" title=\"Services\">Services</a> like Call to Action or 5 Calls, for instance, or even other mobile apps, like Countable.</p><p>It would be great to see Facebook enhance its Town Hall resource with the full contact details for all officials going forward, especially given that this is public information and fairly easy to find even on official government <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>\">website</a>s.</p><p>Beyond following your reps and getting in touch, the Town Hall feature applies a bit of peer pressure to get you involved by noting how many of your friends have connected with a government rep via Facebook. This isn’t all that useful beyond the potential psychological impact it has on users, by making them not want to be left out.</p><p><img src=\"<<[site-url]>>/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Facebook8217s-new-8220Town-Hall8221-feature-helps-you-find-and-contact-your-government-reps-2.jpg\" width=\"383\" height=\"680\" srcset=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/img_3429.jpg?w=383&amp;h=680 383w, https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/img_3429.jpg?w=766&amp;h=1360 766w, https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/img_3429.jpg?w=84&amp;h=150 84w, https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/img_3429.jpg?w=169&amp;h=300 169w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 383px) 100vw, 383px\" alt=\"Facebook&amp;#8217;s new &amp;#8220;Town Hall&amp;#8221; feature helps you find and contact your government reps\"></p><p> </p><p>At the bottom of the page, you can also toggle voting reminders off or on, so you’ll be alerted when there’s an upcoming election in your area.</p><p>Town Hall is hardly Facebook’s first foray into politics. The social network has regularly prompted users to register and to vote through a number of means, including push notifications, banners in its News Feed, Messenger integrations, maps to polls, social sharing features (like “I voted”), and more – including, in this past Presidential Election, an “Election 2016” shortcut in users’ Favorites section on both web and mobile. It also published a voter guide, which included down-ballot propositions and local races.</p><p>We’ve asked Facebook for more details as to the status of the Town Hall feature’s rollout, and will update if the company responds.</p><p>The feature’s arrival follows several other recent additions to Facebook’s sidebar in recent months, including its new City Guides, Wi-Fi Finder, Discover People section, and app/\">Weather</a> guide.</p><p><em>Image credit, top: Marcbela (Marc N.
