	<p>The Sunday Night Blues are real.</p><p>A recent <a href=\"https://www.calm.com/mindfulness-tips/sunday-night-sleep-troubles\">survey</a> conducted through YouGov for meditation platform Calm polled 4,279 Americans and Brits and found that insomnia plagued people the most on Sunday night.</p><p>Forty-six percent reported having trouble sleeping on Sunday night, followed by 17 percent on Monday, 9 percent on Saturday and Wednesday, 8 percent on Tuesday, 7 percent on Friday and oddly enough Thursday came in last with only 5 percent identifying it as the night where they did the most tossing and turning.</p><p>As for Thursday&rsquo;s bottom spot, it stands to reason that if you&rsquo;re working toward the weekend and you&rsquo;ve gotten most of your work done in the days prior, the idea of waking up on a Friday is less stressful.</p><p>So if you&rsquo;re feeling worried about the week ahead, what can you do to wind down and get the best night&rsquo;s rest?</p><p><strong>Put a routine in place to allay your anxiety.</strong><br />Christopher Lindholst, the CEO and co-founder of sleep <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/services/startup-consulting/\" title=\"StartUp\" target=\"_blank\">StartUp</a> Metronaps, says that we all tend to need roughly seven and half hours of sleep to feel the most rested, and that cycles of sleep generally occur in 90 minute increments.</p><p>Set in your mind how much time you need in the morning to get ready and out the door with a minimal amount of stress on Monday morning. Then count backwards using those 90-minute blocks to get to your ideal bedtime.
