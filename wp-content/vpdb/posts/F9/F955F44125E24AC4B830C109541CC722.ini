Could we deploy the same algorithms to read that data?\" </p><p>The answer was yes and the algorithm has been advancing the study of cancer ever since.</p><p>\"Using the astronomy algorithm, we can automatically classify hundreds of thousands of cells, we can look at patterns, how cells are related to each other, we can precisely count them and find the average distance between cells,\" Prof Caldas says.</p><p>\"It speeds up diagnosis and allows us to glean information that had previously been glossed over.</p><p>\"It is completely transforming pathology into the digital realm. </p><p>\"The sky is the limit.\"</p><p>Scientists at Cancer Research UK have just announced a breakthrough in the way they \"read\" breast cancer cells.</p><p>It means that they are now able to create a 3D map that links the shape of breast cancer cells to genes turning on and off, matching it to real disease outcomes.</p><p>It is not just the diagnosis of disease that can be transformed by big-data insights.</p><p>\"Data is exploding but so is the technology and that understand and exploit it,\" said Nick Millman, an analyst at consultancy firm Accenture.</p><p>\"In health, the techniques that have previously been used in marketing <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/services/seo-sem/\" title=\"Analytics\" target=\"_blank\">Analytics</a> that have allowed brands to understand an individual's preferences can be applied to wellness - how to encourage someone to follow a healthier diet, for instance.\"</p><figure>

We imagine the modern world to be fast-paced, connected and interwoven with technology, all things that we owe inescapably to big data.</p><p>\"We can now examine the evolution of language, search the genome for disease, navigate cities yet to be built and identify our common fears.  Our increased connectivity is making us easier to read.\"</p><p>The exhibition features a study done at Cambridge University, which illustrates how easy it is to read our personalities via Facebook likes.</p><p>Volunteers were asked to complete a series of personality tests and that was compared with their Facebook data.</p><p>\"We found we could predict personality as accurately as a spouse from the average person's Facebook likes,\" said David Stillwell.</p><p>\"We could predict intelligence, personality traits, age, gender, religious views.\"</p><figure>
