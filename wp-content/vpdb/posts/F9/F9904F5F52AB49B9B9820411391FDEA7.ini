        </figure><p>Ben Wood thinks there's an engagement issue - after a while these devices don't tell you anything new.</p><p>There's also the battery issue, and the fact that many of the older and cheaper varieties aren't water resistant.</p><p>Furthermore, Simon Bryant from Futuresource says many wearables aren't yet independent enough and rely on being tethered to a smartphone, or replicate a functionality, such as step counting, that the handset already has.</p><p>However Mr Bryant believes that while wearables may be down, they are not yet out.</p><p>\"We feel the slowdown is temporary and the market will accelerate this year,\" he said.</p><p>He thinks that improved power, appearance, and mobile pay options could give them a boost alongside a maturing user group.</p><p>Things do appear to be looking up. Sales figures for 2016 just released by IDC indicate 25% market growth year-on-year, with Fitbit taking the largest share - followed by budget brand Xiaomi.</p><figure>
