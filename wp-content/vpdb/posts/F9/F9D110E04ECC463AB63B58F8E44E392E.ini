			</div><p>The WikiLeaks-hosted “Vault7” collection of documents allegedly leaked from within the CIA’s Computer Operations Group is a messy mix of jargon, incomplete info and broken (or redacted) links. The information is interesting, but it’s quite difficult to find a basic description of many of the terms used, even using the search function. So for everybody’s convenience I’ve gone through the whole pile of docs and listed as many of the tools and techniques mentioned by spook IT as I could find.</p><p><div>

	</div>If there’s any indication of what the thing does, I’ve included it, though some of these are just educated guesses based on the devices being tested on, comments from their developers and so on. All data (such as OS versions affected) is as of the latest document I could find in the leaked files. Images are all from the leaks, as well.</p><p>I’ve included tools that seemed significant but had no real information on them at the bottom of each list. I did not include links because projects and their descriptions are often spread across multiple pages or PDFs. I also did not include commercial tools (such as Lockheed Martin’s DART software testing suite) or operation names (like JQJHAIRPIECE) that seem to merely be specific deployments of other tools.</p><p><strong>This list is by no means comprehensive or authoritative</strong>, nor should the leaked files be considered comprehensive of the hacking tools created and used by the CIA. I’ll be updating it as I find more or things are un-redacted.</p><h4>Embedded Development Branch (EDB)</h4><p><img src=\"<<[site-url]>>/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Names-and-definitions-of-leaked-CIA-hacking-tools.png\" width=\"298\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/edg_logo_original.png?w=298&amp;h=300 298w, https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/edg_logo_original.png?w=150&amp;h=150 150w, https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/edg_logo_original.png 586w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 298px) 100vw, 298px\" alt=\"Names and definitions of leaked CIA hacking tools\">This branch is concerned with compromising and embedding implants in purpose-built devices like VoIP phones, workstations and smart devices like TVs.
