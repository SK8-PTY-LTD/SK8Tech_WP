The promotion, which was announced Monday and ends March 30, will deliver free access to HBO if you subscribe to either the 100-channel Go Big package for $60 a month or the 120-channel Gotta Have It $70 a month plan. </p><p>Considering it's only $5 extra a month to add HBO to any DirecTV Now bundle, the deal is only worth it if you want the other channels offered in either of the higher priced tiers. AT&amp;T also offers 60 channels of DirecTV for $35 a month or 80 channels for $50 a month. </p><p>Earlier this month, AT&amp;T offered a similar promotion to its existing DirecTV Now customers. AT&amp;T is also offering a free apple-tv-2015/\" data-annotation=\"true\">Apple TV</a> streaming device for anyone who prepays for three months of service. This offer also ends March 30.</p><p>DirecTV Now, which launched Nov. 30, is part of AT&amp;T's push to transform itself into more than a phone company. The second largest wireless provider acquired satellite TV provider DirecTV last year and has announced plans to buy Time Warner, which owns HBO, to become a video content and distribution powerhouse.</p>

        </div>                        <p>DirecTV Now is the service that ties it all together. Despite a rocky launch in November when the service choked under demand from users, AT&amp;T still managed to sign up 200,000 customers. But much of this was likely buoyed by the introductory apple-tv-fire-tv/\">promotional offer of 100 channels for $35 a month</a>. Now with a higher price tag, AT&amp;T is looking at new promotions to entice new customers to sign up. </p>
