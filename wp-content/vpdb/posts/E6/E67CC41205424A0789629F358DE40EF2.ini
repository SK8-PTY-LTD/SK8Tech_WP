  <p>Thousands of Twitter users had their accounts hijacked this morning, thanks to a third-party <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/tag/app/\" title=\"App\">App</a>. Big brands and verified accounts were affected, with tweets featuring the Nazi swastika and pro-Erdoğan propaganda. While Twitter wasn’t breached itself, it’s important to check what apps have access to your account. This hack is the latest reminder to run a Twitter security check-up if you haven’t yet. Here’s how:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sign into Twitter
</li>
<li>Check the applications\">applications page</a> to see what apps have access to your account</li>
<li>Revoke as many apps as you can. Try to remove old apps you no longer use, or ones you don’t recognize</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you’ve disabled apps, it’s also worth enabling two-factor authentication on your account. It’s simple to manage through Twitter’s iOS and Android apps, and can be enabled from the account settings section of Twitter. This will help protect against password attacks in the future. </p>
<p>It’s also a good time to consider not being lazy and stop using the same password on every <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/tag/website/\" title=\"Website\">Website</a>. There have been too many high profile password breaches over the last few years making it likely that your reused passwords are in circulation. LastPass is now free, so there’s no excuse not to use a password manager to better secure all of your online accounts.</p>      <div>
