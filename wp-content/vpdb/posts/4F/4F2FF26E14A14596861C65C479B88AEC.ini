It now has 700 million users, more than twice as many as Twitter. And let's not forget that Facebook has nearly 2 billion users as well. </p><p>But Twitter still isn't giving up as it struggles for relevancy, even at a time when Trump continues to use the platform as his sounding board. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey says the company has been trying more tactics to make famous tweeters and tweets easier to find. It's also taken steps to curb abusive behavior from anonymous users. </p><p>And, it's still hoping that livestreaming events, ranging from sports to music to political satire, will bring success, despite losing its marquee sports event after <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/services/e-commerce/\" title=\"E-Commerce\" target=\"_blank\">E-Commerce</a> giant Amazon outbid it for the rights to stream NFL Thursday night football games. </p>

        </div>                        <p>Anthony Noto, the social network's chief operating officer, said during a call with investors Wednesday that Twitter streamed 800 hours of video during the first quarter. He touted a Grammy's red carpet pre-show that drew more than 5 million viewers. </p><p>But Twitter is competing for video ad dollars with Facebook, YouTube and Snapchat in an arena that's predicted to reach $13.2 billion in spending in the US this year and $22.2 billion by 2021, said e-Marketer analyst Debra Aho Williamson.</p><p>\"We'll need a few more quarters' worth of data to know whether this is a solid upward trend or not (for Twitter),\" she said.</p><p> Twitter said while its monthly user total climbed 2.8 percent, its daily active users grew 14 percent year over year, though it did not disclose an actual figure. Still, it's a further sign that those already on Twitter are using it more.</p><p> Noto attributes the slight user increase to Twitter's growing presence in politics, citing Trump's must-see tweets, along those of other world leaders and political activists.</p><p>\"Having political leaders of the world, as well as news agencies driving (politics) reinforces what we're best at,\" he said.</p><div>

		</div><p>The user growth, however, isn't exactly making Twitter rich. Sales fell to $548 million in the period, down 8 percent from this time a year ago, yet beating the $509 million revenue estimates of analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters. </p><p>As a result, Twitter shares had climbed as much as 11 percent Wednesday.</p><p>Dorsey said during an earnings call Wednesday with investors that the company continues \"to face revenue headwinds.\"</p><p>\"We believe that executing on our plan and growing our audience should result in positive revenue growth over the long term,\" he said.</p><p>Twitter's work is far from over, said Forrester analyst Erna Alfred Liousas.  While she agrees with Noto's rationale that the uptick in user growth was organic, there really hasn't been much upside for users or advertisers to join the social network.</p><p>\"Twitter must deliver consistent progress across the <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/services/ui-ux/\" title=\"User Experience\" target=\"_blank\">User Experience</a> for all audiences to meet their goal of making it the place that users go to first,\" she said.</p><p>James Cakmak, an analyst with Moness, Crespi, Hardt &amp; Co., said earlier this week that Twitter needs to do an \"about face\" on getting more users and making more money. He didn't waver on Wednesday.</p><p>\"We are unsure of the sustainability of this performance going forward,\" he said. \"We give credit where credit's due, but at this time, we believe it's prudent to remain on the sidelines until a more cohesive strategy is in place and a track record longer than one quarter is set.\"</p><p><em>First published, April 26 at 4:16 a.m. PT.</em><em><br></em><strong>Update, 12:05 p.m.</strong>: <em>Adds </em><em>more analyst commentary.</em></p>
