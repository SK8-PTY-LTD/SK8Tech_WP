  <p>Microsoft will soon allow participants in the Xbox Insider program to choose a custom image for their gamer pic. No longer will you be limited to an avatar or game-related snapshot. That’s among the changes and new features outlined in a blog post from Major Nelson. Users will be able to choose a custom gamer pic directly from the console, a Windows 10 PC, or a smartphone, so you’ll have plenty of avenues for picking the image you want. </p>
<p>However, Microsoft is already warning that it’s gonna be awhile before this feature comes to <em>all </em>Xbox users. The company expects custom gamer pics “to be in preview longer than other features to ensure it’s great for everyone when released.” That sounds a lot like Microsoft is still figuring out how to moderate images to weed out inappropriate choices. </p>
<p>Another new thing I’m excited about is the ability to filter games by platform (Xbox One / Xbox 360) on the My Apps and Games screen, which will make it easier to put some separation between the latest current-gen releases and your favorite titles of years past. </p>

<p>Microsoft’s also taking care of yet another common player request: captive portal support. Now, your Xbox One will bring up a browser to help you log onto public Wi-Fi networks at public places like college campuses or hotels. Neat. </p>      <div>

<p>Improvements are also coming to Xbox Live clubs and LFG (looking for group) community features, and the long-awaited Arena tournament system is also scheduled to ship to Insider members within the next few weeks. Combined with the recent announcement of Xbox Game Pass, Microsoft is holding to a fast pace of improving the Xbox One platform at every corner. Sony’s also constantly iterating on the PlayStation 4’s software. Hooray for competition and listening to your customers.</p>
