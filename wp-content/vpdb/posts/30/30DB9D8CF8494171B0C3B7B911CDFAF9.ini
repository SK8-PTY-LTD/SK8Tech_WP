<p>Windows Central has gotten its hands on an internal document highlighting the hardware performance of Windows 10 Cloud, a rumored operating system spinoff expected to be unveiled at next month’s big education event in New York. Predictably, the slide puts the OS head to head with Google Chromebooks.</p>
<p>The category is a no-brainer for Microsoft as the company struggles to gain a foothold in the K-12 education space that has been utterly dominated by Google’s cloud-based offering.</p>
<p>Microsoft saw something of a spike in the category in the late-00s, courtesy of the short but vibrant netbook boom, which helped educators realize the long hoped for promise of one-on-one devices for students, but that began to shift as tablets entered the scene. In recent years, however, Chromebooks have utterly dominated the conversation, through a combination of cheap hardware and control by the IT departments that make many of the purchasing decisions for schools and districts.</p>

<p>Microsoft’s main education play of late has been on the Surface side, though iPads have seemingly done a better job capturing the market for schools that don’t mind paying an extra premium for devices. The company was rumored to be launching a Surface Phone or new Surface Pro at the event, but we were able to confirm otherwise.</p><div><div></div></div>
<p>Microsoft’s certainly hinted at its aim to return to low cost education offerings. In January, the company discussed Intune for Education, which brings cloud-based management to a $189 Windows 10 aimed at schools. The event being held on May 2 will almost certainly detail devices it thinks will be able to go head to head with Chromebooks on things like battery life, cost and wide scale device management.</p>
<p>While the company hasn’t had much luck on the education from of late, there may still be demand for a reentry, given Microsoft’s still popular productivity options. Google’s made a lot of progress with its Cloud-based G Suite, but there’s still cachet among professional when it comes to offerings like Office. There’s also something to be said for a system that offers a version of a near ubiquitous ecosystem like Windows.</p>
<p>But even with those factors at play, Microsoft is going to have to offer up a lot more than just a Windows version of the Chromebook if it hopes to make a dent in education.</p>
