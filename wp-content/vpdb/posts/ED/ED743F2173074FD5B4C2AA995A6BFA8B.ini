A slightly more far-out idea suggests a kinetic-powered system that uses steps to power the shoes’ batteries.</p><p>The teardown also revealed an ARM Cortex M4, a mobile processor that seems like a lot of firepower for a self-lacing shoe and, again, could point to something larger down the road.</p>"
