  <p>Stacks of papers are a staple at any regular <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> game, but Wizards of the Coast is finally offering a digital client to help gamers manage their characters. Today at PAX East, the company revealed a new “Digital Toolset” that works with Fifth Edition called D&amp;D Beyond. </p>
<p>Billed as a game management tool, D&amp;D Beyond has an official rules compendium, a character builder and character sheet. From the looks of it, it’s designed to make it easier for players to look up rules and update their characters as they play.</p>
<p>The company partnered with Curse, a media company owned by Twitch that builds gaming management tools for a range of platforms. D&amp;D Beyond appears to be a client designed to bring the traditional pen-and-paper role-playing game into the digital age. </p>
<p>It’s definitely a long-overdue, although not unprecedented tool. There’s been digital accessories for the game in the past, such as TSR’s <em>Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons CD-ROM Core Rules</em> in 1996, and it’s pretty easy to get PDF versions of character sheets to print out. There’s also a huge number of unofficial (and some official) digital programs and home-brewed tools out there for players to use to streamline characters and to look up rules. D&amp;D Beyond looks like a response to that, but one that’s designed to aid the players who gather around the same table to play. As someone who’s had to redo many a character sheet over the years, an intuitive, digital version is something that I’ve wanted for a long time. </p>      <div>

<p>The system is due out sometime this summer, but you can sign up for the Beta now. </p>
