<p>As we inch closer to E3, games are top of mind.</p>
<p>The Destiny 2 gameplay trailer was finally released earlier this week, which you can check out below.</p>
<span style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe type='text/html' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/jn1dML6RC5w?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></span>
<p>But as Forbes pointed out, there is still a hint of mystery and a dash of disappointment when it comes to the Destiny 2 PC port.</p>
<p>For one, Destiny 2 for PC is not officially slated for the same September 8 release date as its PS4 and Xbox One counterparts. That doesn’t mean the game <em>won’t</em> come out in September, but it hasn’t been confirmed and may arrive much later.</p>
<p>Moreover, Destiny 2 for PC — while running at 60fps (yay!) — won’t come with dedicated servers, instead running on peer-to-peer servers. Dedicated servers are more secure and offer way better performance, and it’s still not clear why Bungie and Activision would hesitate to go the extra mile for such a powerhouse game.</p><div><div></div></div>
<p>The last bit of bad news has to do with customized characters, which won’t transfer over from Destiny on console to the Destiny 2 PC port.</p>
<p>That said, the gameplay trailer looks amazing and folks who have actually tried out the game already say that it’s excellent.</p>
<p>You can watch the full reveal below:</p>
