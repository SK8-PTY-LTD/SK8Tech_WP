He said there were faster cars on the market, but these were limited-run vehicles, while the Tesla is aimed at the mass market, he said.</p><p>\"These are very profound milestones and I think will help convince people around the world that electric is the future,\" he said on a conference call with journalists.</p><p>The new battery extends the range of performance versions of the new Model S well beyond 300 miles (482.8 km), from about 290 miles, Tesla said. </p><p>Mr Musk said that in cool weather, a driver could travel from San Francisco to Los Angeles - a nearly 400 mile drive - without recharging.</p><h2>Fatal crash</h2><p>In May, Tesla said it was stepping up production plans for its upcoming Model 3 mass-market sedan and would build a total of 500,000 all-electric vehicles in 2018, two years ahead of schedule. </p><p>The Model S and X vehicles with the upgraded batteries will help fund the more affordable Model 3 still in development, Mr Musk said. The performance versions of the S and X without the new battery currently start at $108,000 and $115,500, respectively.</p><p>But the company also warned that investment would ramp up as well.</p><p>Tesla has been under investigation from US safety regulators following a fatal crash in Florida earlier this year involving its drive-assistance feature known as Autopilot.</p><p>Mr Musk said a software update of the feature is nearing completion, adding that it will result in \"material improvements in the autonomy of the car.\"</p>
