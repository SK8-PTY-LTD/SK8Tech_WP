Oculus already has its Touch controllers that are great for wielding virtual guns or picking up digital objects, but today Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg revealed a new prototype for VR gloves in photos from his tour of the Redmond, Washington Oculus Research.</p><p>Zuckerberg writes, “We’re working on new ways to bring your hands in virtual and augmented reality. Wearing these gloves, you can draw, type on a virtual keyboard, and even shoot webs like Spider-Man. That’s what I’m doing here.”</p><iframe       name=\"wpcom-iframe-f1e1bb094902b711401c9d5eade191c0-589d66cb106dd\"    frameborder=\"0\"    scrolling=\"no\"    width=\"500\"    height=\"846\"    webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe><p>We’ve requested more details about the prototype from Oculus. It looks like the gloves have a slim form-factor. Notably, the rig appears to employ OptiTrack Prime 17W cameras to sense the gloves’ position, rather than an Oculus-built sensor system. This could allow Oculus to more rapidly test the gloves at a lower cost than if it tried to build the cameras too.</p><p>Oculus previously acquired hand-tracking startup Pebbles Interfaces, which was developing technology that could aid in the creation of VR gloves.</p><p><span style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe type=\"text/html\" width=\"640\" height=\"390\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/WkddF7F0zvs?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p><p>Plenty of other VR hardware companies have worked on haptic and trackable gloves. Dexta Robotics’ Dexmo gloves look like mechanical exoskeletons that fit over your hands.

Business Insider yesterday reported Oculus will close 200 of its 500 demo stations inside Best Buy stores, after some stations went days without use.</p><p>Gloves could help Oculus realize the dream of true presence in VR, where there’s nothing to remind you that you aren’t actually in a fantasy world.</p>"
