Four in 10 felt that they were regularly ignored by a friend or relative who was too engrossed in their smartphone or tablet.</p><p>A typical adult spends an average of 25 hours online per week, with nearly half (42%) saying they go online or check apps more than 10 times a day, the research suggests.</p><p>One in 10 accessed the internet more than 50 times daily, according to the study.</p><p>Reliance on the internet seems to be affecting people's personal and working lives, leading one in three (34%) to seek a period of time offline.</p><figure>

        </figure><p>Some 71% of UK adults now own a smartphone.</p><p>According to Andrew Przybylski, an experimental psychologist at the Oxford Internet Institute, the research reflects a growing paradox in everyday life.</p><p>\"Three in four say it brings us in closer touch, but nearly one in two think technology can get in the way,\" he said.</p><p>He added that it was important to understand that the survey was not a study of internet addiction.</p><p>\"That is not a recognised psychiatric disorder. This is more about everyday frustrations, not something as serious a problem as gambling or alcohol use.\"</p><p>The study suggested that the under-25s were the most likely to unplug and unwind, and this is increasingly being reflected in social trends such as phone stacking - where groups out for dinner pile their phones in the centre of the table.</p><p>And bars, such as the Gin Tub in Sussex, are blocking mobile signals on their premises in an attempt to encourage face-to-face conversation.</p><hr><p><strong>Have you ever had 'net overload' or have you ever felt addicted to your mobile?
