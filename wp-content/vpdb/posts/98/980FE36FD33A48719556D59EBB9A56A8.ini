<p>Alright, <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/services/startup-consulting/\" title=\"StartUp\" target=\"_blank\">StartUp</a> fans. We gave you an extension, a whole extra week to save some serious cash on tickets to Disrupt NY 2017. But now your time is almost up.</p>
<p>You have just a few hours left to save $1,000 on tickets to the best <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/services/startup-consulting/\" title=\"StartUp\" target=\"_blank\">StartUp</a> show in the Big Apple. Early bird tickets cost just $1,995 apiece for today only — that price is going to jump to $2,995 tomorrow.</p>
<p>Get your tickets now. In addition to saving you some hard-earned cash, here’s what that early-bird Disrupt ticket gets you.</p>
<p>To kick things off, you’ll get to hear from a series of prominent entrepreneurs and investors in a series of lectures and interviews. These speakers are a veritable who’s who of the tech industry — folks like RRE Ventures Co-Founder &amp; Managing Partner Stuart Ellman, Luma CEO and Founder Paul Judge, former NSA Director Keith Alexander, international chess champion Garry Kasparov and WeWork Co-Founder and CEO Adam Neumann, to name just a few.</p>
<p>Next, you’ll get to wander the <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/services/startup-consulting/\" title=\"StartUp\" target=\"_blank\">StartUp</a> Alley and Hardware Alley, where promising early-stage <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/services/startup-consulting/\" title=\"StartUp\" target=\"_blank\">StartUp</a>s will be demoing their products and services to the thousands of Disrupt attendees on the show floor.</p><div><div></div></div>
<p>Then, you’ll get to check out a few dozen promising early-stage <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/services/startup-consulting/\" title=\"StartUp\" target=\"_blank\">StartUp</a>s as they pitch our panel of judges in the illustrious <a href=\"<<[site-url]>>/services/startup-consulting/\" title=\"StartUp\" target=\"_blank\">StartUp</a> Battlefield competition. Battlefield companies are vying for the chance to win $50,000, the coveted Disrupt Cup and, perhaps most importantly, the attention of the tech community at large.</p>
<p>Finally, you’ll unwind after a long, fun-filled day at Disrupt by attending the after-parties and keep the good times going long after the show floor closes up for the evening.</p>
<p>You’ll need a ticket to take part in any of it, and today is seriously the last day to save a full $1,000 on Disrupt tickets before the price jumps tomorrow. No more extensions, so be sure to get your ticket today!</p>
<p>Disrupt NY 2017 takes place May 15-17 at Manhattan’s Pier 36. We can’t wait to see you there.</p>
