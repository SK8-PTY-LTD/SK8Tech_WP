        </figure><p>One of the hacking tools that featured in a lot of headlines was the Weeping Angel that appears to get a Samsung Smart TV to record conversations.</p><p>It's named after a character in the sci-fi TV series Doctor Who, which appears as still as a statue.</p><p>The name could have been chosen \"because you think it is not alive but it is, you think it isn't doing anything but it is\" says Alan Woodward, a security researcher who advises Europol and previously advised UK spy agency GCHQ.</p><p>The leaks suggest the TV appears to turn itself off and, likewise, the weeping angel can appear to be frozen and come to life when you are not looking.</p><div aria-hidden=\"true\">

</div><p>While the UK's MI5 agency is said to have helped build this spyware, it's possible CIA hackers from the US are also Doctor Who fans. </p><p>Another hacking tool, which attempts to listen to calls on systems such as Skype, is named after the Sontarans. </p><p>These characters look like potatoes and try to conquer the earth by emitting poisoned gas. </p><hr><h2>Ricky Bobby</h2><figure>

        </figure><p>The tool Ricky Bobby can control a computer remotely without detection using commands in Microsoft Windows, according to the leak.</p><p>But it is named after a far more conspicuous character.</p><p>Racing car driver Ricky Bobby was played by Will Ferrell in the 2006 film Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby.</p><p>After crashing in a race, he runs round the track wearing only his helmet and underwear insisting he is on fire. </p><p>He also manages to get his best friend, Cal, to become a car racer.</p><p>This is not lost on the makers of Ricky Bobby the hacking tool. </p><p>When they made a listening post for RickyBobby, they called it Cal.</p><hr><h2>Starving Weasel </h2><figure>

            </span>
            
        </figure><p>One of the leaks suggests hackers love naming their spy tools so much that they come up with names before they've made the tool.</p><p>Starving Weasel is from a long list of names for future tools chosen \"because they are awesome\".</p><p>\"These are mostly oblique references to things I like, TV tropes names that amuse me and situations or phrases at work encoded in toolname-esque obscurity,\" says the person whose name has been replaced with User #77010. </p><p>Oblique is an understatement.</p><p>Starving Weasel is a reference to a lyric from mid-way through an 11-minute song by Weird Al Yankovic.</p><p>In the song Albuquerque, Weird Al goes to the doughnuts shop only to be told there are no doughnuts left but there is a \"box of one dozen starving, crazed weasels\".</p><p>He buys the weasels and they jump out of their box and start eating his face, at which point he meets the woman of his dreams.</p><hr><h2>Maddening Whispers</h2><figure>

            </span>
            
        </figure><p>This is where the CIA hackers may reveal themselves in their geekiest form, because Maddening Whispers is a reference to the online role-playing game World of Warcraft.</p><p>\"It's almost too stereotypical - it's really painting a picture of a hacker who likes pizza, beer, science fiction and online gaming,\" says Mr Woodward.</p><p>The game sees players exploring a vast landscape full of monsters, completing quests and interacting with other gamers.</p><p>Maddening Whispers is a spell in the game, which, when you deploy it, slowly weakens your opponent. </p><p>As for the tool, it tries to get remote access to a device named Vanguard.</p><p>Mr Woodward is unsure what this refers to but suggests it could be Vanguard alarm systems. </p><p>Niche on both counts.</p><hr><h2>Snowy Owl </h2><figure>

            </span>
            
        </figure><p>Some hacking tools are named after slightly more obvious signs of aggression: birds of prey. </p><p>Bald eagle, harpy eagle and sparrowhawk all feature.</p><p>A bird of prey can swoop on its victim almost silently. </p><p>Similarly, the sparrowhawk tool can detect the letters you are hitting on a keyboard without you having any idea you are being watched.</p><p>Then there is the less threatening snowy owl, which is described in the leaks as a tool designed to remotely operate a Mac computer. </p><p>There is a possibility it was not named after the bird at all but instead was inspired by the Brownies. </p><p>In a Brownie troop the Snowy Owl is an adult who helps the leader of the troop, the Brown Owl.</p><p>\"Maybe we have our first indication that there is a woman involved,\" speculates Mr Woodward. </p>
